			<p><p><strong>Vehicles with a High Voltage System (Hybrid Vehicles)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Extremely Dangerous Due to High-Voltage</strong></p>
<p>The high-voltage system is under high-voltage. Death or serious 
bodily injury by electric shock.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Individuals with electronic/medical life- and health sustaining 
machines in or on their person cannot perform any work on high-voltage 
systems. Life- and health sustaining machines are for example pain 
killer pumps, implanted defibrillators, pacemakers, insulin pumps, and 
hearing aids.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Have the high-voltage system de-energized by a qualified person.</p>
<p><strong>There is a Risk Of Injury from the Engine Starting Unexpectedly</strong></p>
<p>On electric - hybrid vehicles an active ready mode is difficult to 
identify. Parts of the body can be clamped or pulled.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Turn off the ignition.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Place the ignition key outside of the vehicle interior.</p>
<p><strong>Risk of Damaging the High-Voltage Cables</strong></p>
<p>Misuse can damage the insulation of high-voltage cables or 
high-voltage connectors.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Never support objects on the high-voltage cables and the 
high-voltage connectors.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Never support tools on the high-voltage cables and the high-voltage 
connectors.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Never sharply bend or kink the high-voltage cables.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;When connecting pay attention to the coding of the high-voltage 
connectors.</p>
<ul>
	<li>For all procedures on vehicles with high-voltage system pay 
attention to the additional warning message for these vehicles. 
Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Warnings when Working on Vehicles with High Voltage 
System".</li>
	<li>If procedures are necessary near components of the 
high-voltage system "perform a visual inspection of the damage 
of the high-voltage components and lines". Refer to
→&nbsp;Chapter "Performing a Visual Inspection of Damage to High 
Voltage Components and Cables".</li>
	<li>If work on the components of the high-voltage system is 
necessity, de-energize the high-voltage system. Refer to
→&nbsp;Rep. Gr.93;&nbsp;High-Voltage System, De-Energizing or
→&nbsp;Electrical Equipment;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.93;&nbsp;High-Voltage System, 
De-Energizing.</li>
</ul>
<p>-&nbsp;Charge the vehicle battery, for example, using the Battery 
Charger -VAS5904- in the battery support mode to minimize the 
number of automatic starts during the test- and measuring 
procedures while the ready mode is active. Refer to
→&nbsp;Electrical Equipment General Information;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.27;&nbsp;Battery; 
Charging the Battery and 
→&nbsp;Electrical Equipment;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.93;&nbsp;General Notes for Working on 
the High Voltage System.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Move the selector level into position "P", activate the 
parking brake and arrange the necessary tools for testing and 
measuring procedures that require the ready mode to be active or 
that require the ignition to be on, so that they cannot come 
into contact with the turning components in the engine and so 
that they are not in the vicinity of the turning components of a 
running engine.</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Also move the selector lever into position "P" and activate 
the parking brake for testing and measuring procedures which 
require the ignition to be on, but do not require the ready mode 
to be active.</em></li>
	<li><em>The ready mode is displayed in the Instrument Cluster 
Control Module -J285- above the "powermeter". Refer to Owner's 
Manual.</em></li>

<p><strong>All Vehicles</strong></p>
<p>-&nbsp;Turn on the A/C service station and flush the refrigerant 
circuit (duration approximately one to one and a half hours for 
one flushing cycle with three flushing operations).</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Perform flushing procedure according to operating 
instructions of the A/C service station. Refer to the operating 
instructions for the A/C service station.</em></li>
	<li><em>Depending on version of A/C service station, old oil 
container holds only approximately 125 cm <sup>3</sup> refrigerant oil, in the event a system with a larger 
quantity of refrigerant oil must be flushed, it may be necessary 
to drain the old oil container after the first flushing process 
of one flushing cycle.</em></li>
	<li><em>Observe the refrigerant which flows back into the A/C 
service station from the refrigerant circuit, only when the 
refrigerant streams clear and completely colorless through the 
viewing glass of refrigerant circuit flushing device into the 
A/C service station is the refrigerant circuit cleaned. </em> </li>
	<li><em>While flushing, all the refrigerant oil is washed out of the 
refrigerant circuit (up to a very small amount, for example in 
the evaporator, however this can be disregarded).</em></li>
	<li><em>If heavily contaminated, it may be necessary to perform the 
flushing procedure twice (two flushing cycles with three 
flushing operations each).</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Sequence of flushing procedure 
(sequence occurs automatically according to the A/C service 
station program)</p>
<ul>
	<li>After turning on, the flushing circuit (refrigerant circuit 
with connecting hoses and flushing equipment for refrigerant 
circuits) is evacuated first and the refrigerant circuit is 
checked for leaks during this. Depending on the A/C service 
station version, it is possible that manually switching to 
advance the program is required. Refer to the operating 
instructions for the A/C service station.</li>
	<li>A prescribed quantity of refrigerant (such as 5 kg) is 
filled into the evacuated refrigerant circuit via the high 
pressure side of the A/C service station (in opposite direction 
of normal flow when A/C system is in operation and also on the 
low pressure side of the vehicle refrigerant circuit), or, as 
much refrigerant is filled until refrigerant circuit and viewing 
glasses of refrigerant circuit flushing device are completely 
filled with fluid refrigerant (depending on version of A/C 
service station, recognized, for example, that refrigerant no 
longer flows from behind over a certain time period).</li>
	<li>After the prescribed quantity of refrigerant has been 
filled, for example, the heater for the refrigerant circuit 
flushing device is turned on (only in the event the refrigerant 
is extracted in gaseous form from the refrigerant circuit 
flushing device), depending on version of A/C service station 
and refrigerant circuit flushing device.</li>
	<li>After the refrigerant was extracted, the heating of the 
flushing device for refrigerant circuits is switched off (if 
present), it may occur that the refrigerant circuit is shortly 
evacuated again, depending on its version. After evacuation, the 
refrigerant extracted from the refrigerant circuit is deposited 
by the service station.</li>
	<li>The sequence of filling refrigerant, extracting (and 
evacuating) is repeated twice (performed a total of three 
times). Refer to the operating instructions for the A/C service 
station.</li>
	<li>After the third extraction, the flushing circuit is 
evacuated depending on the version of the A/C service station.</li>
</ul>
<p>-&nbsp;After the flushing procedure has ended, check the viewing 
glass(es) of refrigerant circuit flushing device, if they are 
soiled, clean them if necessary according to operating 
instructions of the refrigerant circuit flushing device or of 
the A/C service station and perform the flushing procedure once 
more as a test (one cycle is sufficient, duration approximately 
30 minutes). refer to the operating instructions for the A/C 
service station.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Check the pressure in the refrigerant circuit, there must be 
no positive pressure in the refrigerant circuit (evacuate 
briefly once more if necessary).</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Disconnect the connections to the A/C service station from 
the vehicle refrigerant circuit (there must be no positive 
pressure in the refrigerant circuit).</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Replace these components depending on equipment (restrictor 
and reservoir, expansion valve and receiver/dryer or dryer 
cartridge in the receiver/dryer). Refer to 
→&nbsp;Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.87;&nbsp;System 
Overview - Refrigerant Circuit (vehicle-specific
