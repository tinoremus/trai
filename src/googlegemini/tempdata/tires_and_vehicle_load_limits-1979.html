				<div style="text-decoration:none;"><a href="audi_a4_b9_2016_2023_owner_s_manual-1816.html">Audi A4 (B9) 2016-2023 Owner's Manual</a> / <a href="maintenance_and_care-1962.html">Maintenance and Care</a> / <a href="wheels-1975.html">Wheels</a> /  Tires and vehicle load limits</div></div>
						<p></p>
			<p><p>There are limits to the amount of
load or weight that any vehicle
and any tire can carry. A vehicle
that is overloaded will not handle well and is more difficult to stop.</p>
<p>Overloading can not only lead to
loss of vehicle control, but can also
damage important parts of the
vehicle and can lead to sudden tire failure, including a blowout
and sudden deflation that can
cause the vehicle to crash.</p>
<p>Your safety and that of your passengers
also depends on making
sure that load limits are not exceeded.</p>
<p>
Vehicle load includes everybody
and everything in and on
the vehicle. These load limits are
technically referred to as the vehicle's
Gross Vehicle Weight Rating
("GVWR").</p>
<p>The "GVWR" includes the weight
of the basic vehicle, all factory installed
accessories, a full tank of
fuel, oil, coolant and other fluids plus maximum load. The maximum
load includes the number of
passengers that the vehicle is intended
to carry ("seating capacity")
with an assumed weight of
150 lbs. (68 kg) for each passenger
at a designated seating position
and the total weight of any
luggage in the vehicle. If you tow
a trailer, the weight of the trailer
hitch and the tongue weight of
the loaded trailer must be included
as part of the vehicle load.</p>
<p>The Gross Axle Weight Rating
("GAWR") is the maximum load
that can be applied at each of the
vehicle's two axles.</p>
<p>
The fact that there is an upper
limit to your vehicle's Gross Vehicle
Weight Rating means that the
total weight of whatever is being
carried in the vehicle (including
the weight of a trailer hitch and
the tongue weight of the loaded
trailer) is limited. The more passengers
in the vehicle or passengers
who are heavier than the
standard weights assumed mean
that less weight can be carried as
luggage.</p>
<p>
The Gross Vehicle Weight Rating
and the Gross Axle Weight Rating are listed on the safety compliance
sticker on the driver's side Bpillar
respectively on the front
end of the driver's door.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p><u><strong>Overloading a vehicle can cause
loss of vehicle control, a crash
or other accident, serious personal
injury, and even death.</strong></u></p>
<ul>
	<li><u><strong>Carrying more weight than
	your vehicle was designed to
	carry will prevent the vehicle
	from handling properly and increase
	the risk of the loss of
	vehicle control.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>The brakes on a vehicle that
	has been overloaded may not
	be able to stop the vehicle
	within a safe distance.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Tires on a vehicle that has
	been overloaded can fail suddenly,
	including a blowout and
	sudden deflation, causing loss
	of control and a crash.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Always make sure that the total
	load being transported -
	including the weight of a trailer
	hitch and the tongue
	weight of a loaded trailer -
	does not make the vehicle
	heavier than the vehicle's
	Gross Vehicle Weight Rating.</strong></u></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Determining correct load limit</strong></p>
<p>Use the example below to calculate
the total weight of the passengers
and luggage or other
things that you plan to transport
so that you can make sure that
your vehicle will not be overloaded.</p>
<p><strong>Steps for Determining Correct
Load Limit</strong></p>
<p>1. Locate the statement "THE
COMBINED WEIGHT OF OCCUPANTS
AND CARGO SHOULD
NEVER EXCEED XXX KG OR XXX
LBS" on your vehicle's placard
(tire inflation pressure label)
fig. 167.</p>
<p>
2. Determine the combined
weight of the driver and passengers
that will be riding in
your vehicle.</p>
<p>
3. Subtract the combined weight
of the driver and passengers
from "XXX" kilograms or "XXX"
pounds shown on the sticker
fig. 167.</p>
<p>
4. The resulting figure equals the
available amount of cargo and
luggage load capacity. For example,
if the "XXX" amount
equals 1400 lbs. and there will be five 150 lbs. passengers in
your vehicle, the amount of
available cargo and luggage
load capacity is 650 lbs.</p>
<p>
(1400-750 (5 x 150) = 650
lbs.)</p>
<p>5. Determine the combined
weight of luggage and cargo
being loaded on the vehicle.</p>
<p>
That weight may not safely exceed
the available cargo and
luggage load capacity calculated
in Step 4.</p>
<p>
6. If your vehicle will be towing a
trailer, load from your trailer
will be transferred to your vehicle.</p>
<p>
Consult this manual to
determine how this reduces
the available cargo and luggage
load capacity of your vehicle.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Check the tire sidewall
	(fig. 164) to determine
	the designated load rating
	for a specific tire.</li>
</ul>
<p><u><strong>Wheel bolts and rims</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Wheel bolts</strong></p>
<p>Wheel bolts must be clean and loosen/tighten
easily.</p>
<p><strong>Rims</strong></p>
<p>Rims with a bolted rim ring* or with bolted wheel
covers* consist of multiple pieces. These components
were bolted together using special bolts and a special procedure. You must not 
repair or
disassemble them.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p><u><strong>Wheel bolts that are tightened or repaired incorrectly
can become loose and result in loss
of vehicle control, which increases the risk of
an accident. For the correct tightening specification.</strong></u></p>
<ul>
	<li><u><strong>Always keep the wheel bolts and the threads
	in the wheel hub clean and free of grease.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Only use wheel bolts that fit the rim.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Always have damaged rims repaired by an
	authorized Audi dealer or authorized Audi
	Service Facility. Never repair or disassemble
	rims yourself, because this increases the risk
	of an accident.</strong></u></li>
</ul>
<p><u><strong>Winter tires</strong></u></p>
<p>Winter tires significantly improve the vehicle's
handling when driving in winter conditions. Because
of their construction (width, compound,
tread pattern), summer tires provide less traction
on ice and snow.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use winter tires on all four wheels.</li>
	<li>Only use winter tires that are approved for your
	vehicle.</li>
	<li>Please note that the maximum permitted speed may be lower with winter 
	tires in
	General information. An authorized
	Audi dealer or authorized Audi Service Facility
	can inform you about the maximum permitted
	speed for your tires.</li>
	<li>Check the tire pressure after installing wheels.</li>
</ul>
<p>The effectiveness of winter tires is reduced greatly
when the tread is worn down to a depth of
0.16 in (4 mm). The characteristics of winter
tires also decrease greatly as the tire ages, regardless
of the remaining tread.</p>
<p><strong>For the sake of the environment</strong></p>
<p><u>Reinstall summer tires at the appropriate
time, because they provide better handling
when roads are free of snow and ice. Summer tires cause less road noise, tire 
wear, and fuel
consumption.</u></p>
<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
<p><u>You can also use all season tires instead of
winter tires. Please note that in some countries
where winter tires are required, only
winter tires with the&nbsp; <img border="0" src="images/books/1816/index.50(7).png"> symbol 
may be permitted.</u></p>
<p><u><strong>Snow chains</strong></u></p>
<p>Snow chains improve both driving and braking in
winter road conditions.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Only install snow chains on the front wheels.</li>
	<li>Check and correct the seating of the snow
	chains after driving a few feet, if necessary. Follow
	the instructions from the manufacturer.</li>
	<li>Note the maximum speed of 30 mph
	(50 km/h). Observe the local regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use of snow chains is only permitted with certain
rim/tire combinations due to technical reasons.</p>
<p>
Check with an authorized Audi dealer or authorized
Audi Service Facility to see if you may use
snow chains.</p>
<p>
Use fine-mesh snow chains. They must not add
more than 0.53 inch (13.5 mm) in height, including
the chain lock.</p>
<p>
You must remove the snow chains on roads without
snow. Otherwise, you could impair driving
ability and damage the tires.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Using incorrect snow chains or installing snow
chains incorrectly can result in loss of vehicle
control, which increases the risk of an accident.</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p><em>Snow chains can damage the rims and wheel
covers* if the chains come into direct contact
with them. Remove the wheel covers* first.</em></p><em>
</em><p><em>
Use coated snow chains.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
<p><em>When using snow chains, it may be advisable
to limit the ESC.</em></p>
<p><u><strong>Low-profile tires</strong></u></p>
<p><em>Applies to: vehicles with low-profile tires</em></p>
<p>Compared to other tire/rim combinations, low-profile
tires offer a wider tread surface and a
larger rim diameter with shorter tire sidewalls.</p>
<p>
This results in an agile driving style. However, it
may reduce the level of comfort and increase
road noise when driving on roads in poor condition.</p>
<p>
Low-profile tires can become damaged more
quickly than standard tires when driving over
large bumps, potholes, manhole covers, and
curbs. Therefore, it is particularly important to
maintain the correct tire pressure.</p>
<p>
To reduce the risk of damage to the tires and
rims, drive very carefully on poor roads.</p>
<p>
Check your wheels regularly every 2,000 mi
(3,000 km) for damage. For example, check for
bulges/cracks on the tires or deformations/
cracks on the rims.</p>
<p>
After a heavy impact or damage, have the tires
and rims inspected or replaced immediately by
an authorized Audi dealer or authorized Audi
Service Facility.</p>
<p>
Low-profile tires can wear out faster than standard
tires.</p>
<p><u><strong>Uniform tire quality grading</strong></u></p>
<ul>
	<li>Tread wear</li>
	<li>Traction AA A B C</li>
	<li>Temperature A B C</li>
</ul>
<p>Quality grades can be found where applicable on
the tire side wall between tread shoulder and
maximum section width fig. 164.</p>
<p>For example: Tread wear 200, Traction AA, Temperature
A.</p>
<p>
All passenger car tires must conform to Federal
Safety Requirements in addition to these grades.</p>
<p><strong>Tread wear</strong></p>
<p>The tread wear grade is a comparative rating
based on the wear rate of the tire when tested
under controlled conditions on a specified government
test course.</p>
<p>
For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one
and one half (1 1/2) times as well on the government
course as a tire graded 100.</p>
<p>
The relative performance of tires depends upon
the actual conditions of their use, however, and
may depart significantly from the norm due to
variations in driving habits, service practices and
differences in road characteristics and climate.</p>
<p><strong>Traction</strong></p>
<p>The traction grades, from highest to lowest, are
AA, A, B and C. Those grades represent the tire's
ability to stop on wet pavement as measured under
controlled conditions on specified government
test surfaces of asphalt and concrete. A tire
marked C may have poor traction performance.</p>
<p><strong>Temperature</strong></p>
<p>The temperature grades are A (the highest), B,
and C, representing the tire's resistance to the
generation of heat and its ability to dissipate
heat when tested under controlled conditions on
a specified indoor laboratory test wheel.</p>
<p>
Sustained high temperature can cause the material
of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life,
and excessive temperature can lead to sudden
tire failure.</p>
<p>
The grade C corresponds to a level of performance
which all passenger car tires must meet under
the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard
No. 109. Grades B and A represent higher levels
of performance on the laboratory test wheel than
the minimum required by law.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p><u><strong>The traction grade assigned to this tire is
based on straight-ahead braking traction
tests, and does not include acceleration, cornering,
hydroplaning or peak traction characteristics.</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>The temperature grade for this tire is established
for a tire that is properly inflated and
not overloaded. Excessive speed, underinflation,
or excessive loading, either separately or
in combination, can cause heat buildup and
possible tire failure.</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Temperature grades apply to tires that are
properly inflated and not over or underinflated.</u></strong></p><ul></ul></table></ul><div style="clear:both"></div><div align="center"></div><h2 style="border-top:1px solid #222; padding-top:15px; margin-top: 15px;">READ NEXT:</h2>
