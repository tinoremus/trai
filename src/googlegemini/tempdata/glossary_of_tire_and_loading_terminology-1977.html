<p><strong>Ply</strong></p>
<p>means a layer of rubber-coated
parallel cords.</p>
<p><strong>Production options weight</strong></p>
<p>means the combined weight of

(2.3 kg) in excess of those standard
items which they replace, not
previously considered in curb
weight or accessory weight, including
heavy duty brakes, ride
levelers, roof rack, heavy duty
battery, and special trim.</p>
<p><strong>Radial ply tire</strong></p>
<p>means a pneumatic tire in which
the ply cords that extend to the
beads are laid at substantially
90 degrees to the centerline of
the tread.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended inflation
pressure</strong></p>
<p>see Cold tire inflation
pressure.</p>
<p><strong>Reinforced tire</strong></p>
<p>means a tire designed to operate
at higher loads and at higher inflation
pressures than the corresponding
standard tire. Reinforced
tires may be identified as
"XL", "xl", "EXTRA LOAD", or "RF"
on the sidewall.</p>
<p><strong>Rim</strong></p>
<p>means a metal support for a tire
or a tire and tube assembly upon
which the tire beads are seated.</p>
<p><strong>Rim diameter</strong></p>
<p>means nominal diameter of the
bead seat. If you change your
wheel size, you will have to purchase

<p><strong>Rim width</strong></p>
<p>means nominal distance between

<p><strong>Speed rating (letter code)</strong></p>
<p>means the speed at which a tire is
designed to be driven for extended
periods of time. The ratings
range from 93 mph (150 km/h)
to 186 mph (298 km/h) &gt; table. You may not find
this information on all tires because
it is not required by law.</p>
<p>
The speed rating letter code,
where applicable, is molded on
the tire sidewall and indicates the maximum permissible road
speeds.</p>
<p><strong>Tire pressure monitoring
system</strong></p>

a visual indication of the degrees
of wear of the tread. See Treadwear indicator
for more information on measuring
tire wear.</p>
<p><strong>Uniform Tire Quality Grading</strong></p>
<p>is a tire information system developed
by the United States National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA) that is designed
to help buyers make relative comparisons among tires. The UTQG is
not a safety rating and not a guarantee
that a tire will last fora
prescribed number of miles (kilometers)
or perform in a certain
way. It simply gives tire buyers additional
information to combine
with other considerations, such as
price, brand loyalty and dealer
recommendations. Under UTQG,
tires are graded by the tire manufacturers
in three areas: treadwear,
traction, and temperature
resistance. The UTQG information
on the tires, molded into the sidewalls.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. DOT Tire Identification
Number (TIN)</strong></p>
<p>This is the tire's "serial number".</p>
<p>
It begins with the letters "DOT"
and indicates that the tire meets
all federal standards. The next
two numbers or letters indicate
the plant where it was manufactured,
and the last four numbers
represent the week and year of
manufacture. For example, </p>
<p><strong>DOT... 2221...</strong></p>
<p>means that the tire was produced
in the 22nd week of 2021. The
other numbers are marketing codes
that may or may not beused by the tire manufacturer. This information
is used to contact consumers
if a tire defect requires a
recall.</p>
<p><strong>Vehicle capacity weight</strong></p>
<p>means the rated cargo and luggage
load plus 150 lbs. (68 kilograms)
times the vehicle's designated
seating capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Vehicle maximum load on the
tire</strong></p>
<p>means that load on an individual
tire that is determined by distributing
to each axle its share of the
maximum loaded vehicle weight
and dividing by two.</p>
<p><strong>Vehicle normal load on the tire</strong></p>
<p>means that load on an individual
tire that is determined by distributing
to each axle its share of the
curb weight, accessory weight,
and normal occupant weight (distributed
in accordance with &gt; table) and dividing by
two.</p>
<p><strong>Occupant loading and distribution
for vehicle normal load
for various designated seating
capacities</strong></p>
<p>Refer to the tire inflation pressure
label fig. 167 for the number of seating positions.</p>
<p>
Refer to the table for the number of
people that correspond to the vehicle
normal load.</p><ul></ul></table></ul><div style="clear:both"></div><div align="center"></div><h2 style="border-top:1px solid #222; padding-top:15px; margin-top: 15px;">READ NEXT:</h2>
