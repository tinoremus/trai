<strong>Note</strong></p>
<p><em>On vehicles with a high-voltage system but without a heat 
pump (for example on Audi A3 e-tron, Audi Q5 hybrid, Audi A6 
hybrid and Audi A8 hybrid) no check valves are installed in the 
refrigerant circuit. On these vehicles valves are installed in 
the refrigerant circuit which regulate the flow of the 
refrigerant to the evaporator (in the heater and A/C unit) or to 
the heat exchanger for the cooling of the components of the 
high-voltage system. These valves only have two operating 
conditions (open or closed). Refer to 
→&nbsp;Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning;&nbsp;Rep. 
Gr.87;&nbsp;Refrigerant Circuit; System Overview - Refrigerant 
Circuit and refer to the 
→&nbsp;Vehicle Diagnostic Tester in the "Guided Fault Finding" 
function A/C system and battery control.</em></p>
<p><strong>High-Pressure Side:</strong></p>
<p>Increasing from initial pressure (when connecting the 
pressure gauges) to a maximum of 20 bar (290 psi).</p>
<p><strong>Low-Pressure Side:</strong></p>
<p>Decreasing from initial pressure (when connecting the 
pressure gauges) to a value between 1.5 and 2.3 bar (21.7 and 
33.35 psi) absolute pressure (depending on the required cooling 
output).</p>
<p><strong>A/C Compressor Speed:</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the required cooling output between 800 and 
8600/min (currently a maximum of 5000/min for parked vehicles).</p>

<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>The temperature of the air after the evaporator, the current 
A/C compressor speed and the pressure of the refrigerant on the 
high pressure side are displayed depending on the vehicle as the 
measured value from the different control modules (for example 
the display control head, the Climatronic Control Module -J255-, 
the Front A/C Display Control Head -E87-, the Thermal Management 
Control Module -J1024- etc.). Use the Vehicle Diagnostic Tester 
in the "Guided Fault Finding" function of the A/C system. Refer 
to 
→&nbsp;Wiring diagrams, Troubleshooting &amp; Component locations.</em></li>
	<li><em>If a high cooling output is required (for example, a high 
outside temperature and the blower speed set on high), then the 
A/C compressor will not bring the pressure on the low pressure 
side to the required value (for example, for a certain time 
after turning on the A/C). The A/C compressor is not actuated at 
the maximum specified speed (of approximately 8500/min) on a 
stationary or slow moving vehicle (up to a speed of 
approximately 45km/h) (the A/C compressor speed is limited to 
approximately 5000/min). After a vehicle reaches a speed of more 
than approximately 45 km/h, the limit for the maximum 
permissible A/C compressor speed is lifted. At a A/C compressor 
speed of 5000/min, a high outside temperature and a high fresh 
air blower speed (inefficient environmental controls), the A/C 
compressor output (the delivery volume) is no longer sufficient 
to reduce the pressure on the low pressure side to the target 
value. To check the A/C compressor control under these 
conditions, for example, the fresh air blower is controlled only 
with approximately 40% of the maximum voltage, check the 
pressures at a lower fresh air blower speed. Use the Vehicle 
Diagnostic Tester in the "Guided Fault Finding" Function for A/C 
System and the Battery Regulation and the

(vehicle-specific repair manual).</em></li>
	<li><em>Under unfavorable conditions (very high ambient 
temperatures, high humidity), pressure on high-pressure side may 
increase to max. 29 bar (421 psi).</em></li>
	<li><em>The specified rpm of the A/C compressor is displayed as the 
measured value of the different control modules depending on the 
vehicle (for example from the display control head, the Climatronic Control Module -J255-). Use the Vehicle Diagnostic 
Tester in the "Guided Fault Finding" function of the A/C system. 
Refer to 
→&nbsp;Wiring diagrams, Troubleshooting &amp; Component locations.)</em></li>
	<li><em>The measured high pressure of the respective sensor (for 
example from the A/C Pressure/Temperature Sensor -G395- or by 
the Refrigerant Circuit Pressure Sensor -G805-) is displayed as 
a measured value from the respective control module (for example 
from the Climatronic Control Module -J255- display control 
head). Use the Vehicle Diagnostic Tester in the "Guided Fault 
Finding" function for the air conditioner. Refer to
→&nbsp;Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.00;&nbsp;Repair 
Instructions; Checking Cooling Output 
(vehicle-specific repair manual).</em></li>
	<li><em>The low pressure settles depending on the A/C compressor 
speed and the control characteristic of the expansion valve 
within the compressor output range in tolerance range (1.5 to 
2.3 bar (22 to 33 psi) positive pressure).</em></li>
	<li><em>The target speed for the A/C compressor must be greater than 
1500/min for this test.</em></li>
	<li><em>In setting "maximum cooling output" the target speed is 
regulated to approximately 4000 up to 5000/min. This value is 
vehicle-specific and is displayed as a measured value of the 
respective control module (for example the Climatronic Control 
Module -J255-) display and control head. Use the Vehicle 
Diagnostic Tester in the "Guided Fault Finding" Function for A/C 
System and Battery Regulator.</em></li>
	<li><em>At absolute pressure, 0 bar/psi corresponds to absolute 
vacuum. Normal ambient pressure corresponds to 1 bar (14.5 psi) 
absolute pressure. On the scales of most pressure gauges, 0 
bar/psi corresponds to an absolute pressure of 1 bar (14.5 psi) 
(can be seen from -1 bar (-14.5 psi) mark below 0). Use the

Instructions; Checking Cooling Output 
(vehicle-specific repair manual).</em></li>
	<li><em>If, on a vehicle with two evaporators (for example on a Audi 
A8 hybrid, one in the A/C unit and one for cooling the 
high-voltage components, for example, in the battery cooling 
module or the high-voltage battery heat exchanger as in the Audi 
A3 e-tron), the measured temperature on one evaporator 
corresponds to the specified value or the specified value falls 
short, but does not reach the required specified value on the 
other evaporator, the following adjustment is performed: the 
responsible control module (the Battery Regulation Control 
Module -J840- or the Climatronic Control Module -J255-) 
activates the Electrical A/C Compressor -V470- with increased 
speed via various other control modules (for example, the 
Electric Drive Power and Control Electronics -JX1- and the A/C 
Compressor Control Module -J842-). Thereby increasing the A/C 
cooling output and decreasing the pressure on the low pressure 
side as well as the evaporator temperature. If the specified 
value for the temperature falls short at one evaporator, the 
relevant control module (for example the Battery Regulation 
Control Module -J840- or the Climatronic Control Module -J255-) 
activates the installed shut-off valves (Hybrid Battery 
Refrigerant Shut-Off Valve 1 -N516-, Heater and A/C Unit 
Refrigerant Cut-Off Valve -N541-, Hybrid Battery Refrigerant 
Shut-Off Valve 2 -N517- or High Voltage Battery Heater Core 
Refrigerant Cut-Off Valve -N542-) so that the evaporator which 
is too cold is no longer supplied with refrigerant. Use the 
Vehicle Diagnostic Tester in the "Guided Fault Finding" Function 
for A/C System and refer to

and 
→&nbsp;Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.00;&nbsp;Repair 
Instructions; Checking Cooling Output 
(vehicle-specific repair manual).</em></li>
	<li><em>Since the evaporator for cooling the high-voltage components 
output (in the battery cooling module and in the high-voltage 
battery heat exchanger) is essential for the evaporator output 
in the A/C unit, the required target temperature may still be 
reached in the evaporator for cooling the high-voltage battery 
with too little refrigerant in the refrigerant circuit, but the 
target temperature in the A/C unit evaporator will no longer be 
attainable (even though the A/C compressor is activated with 
increased A/C unit speed).</em></li>

A/C compressor is actuated to maximum output and the low pressure drops 
to value in graph or below (A/C compressor draws off refrigerant from

required specified temperature may still be reached in the evaporator 
for cooling the high-voltage battery with too little refrigerant in the 
circuit, but the specified temperature in the A/C unit evaporator will 
no longer be attainable (even though the A/C compressor is activated 
with increased speed).</em></li>
	<li><em>If there is too much refrigerant oil in the circuit, the compressor 
must be drained (flushed) and the receiver/dryer or dryer cartridge must 
be replaced. After cleaning the refrigerant circuit (flushing with 
refrigerant R134a. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Refrigerant Circuit, Cleaning (Flushing), with Refrigerant 
R134a"; or blowing through using compressed air and nitrogen. 
Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Refrigerant Circuit, Flushing with Compressed Air and 
Nitrogen"), the correct quantity of refrigerant oil is filled 
into the circuit (in the A/C compressor). Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Approved Refrigerant Oils and Capacities".</em></li>

Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Refrigerant Circuit, Flushing with Compressed Air and 
Nitrogen" when this problem occurs since normally there is 
only a small quantity of moisture in the system which can be removed by 
lengthy evacuation.</em></li>
	<li><em>If a problem involving moisture in refrigerant circuit only occurs 
after a lengthy operating period or only infrequently (low pressure 
drops below specification and evaporator ices up), it is sufficient to 
replace the dryer installed in receiver/dryer (adjust quantity of 
refrigerant oil). Refrigerant circuit is then to be evacuated for at 
least three hours.</em></li>
	<li><em>With this malfunction, evaporator may ice up although the quantity 
of refrigerant in circuit is OK.</em></li>
	<li><em>Likewise, the refrigerant circuit may become iced if there is a 
malfunction on the Evaporator Vent Temperature Sensor -G263- or/and on 
the Temperature Sensor after Hybrid Battery Evaporator -G757- (depending 
on the vehicle). For these concerns also pay attention to the measured 
value of the Evaporator Vent Temperature Sensor -G263- and the 
Temperature Sensor after Hybrid Battery Evaporator -G757- (for example 
on vehicles with a battery cooling module). Use the Vehicle Diagnostic 
Tester in the "Guided Fault Finding" function. Refer to

	<li><em>If there is a fault in the A/C compressor ( the A/C compressor is
