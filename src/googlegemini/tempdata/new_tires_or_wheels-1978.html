						<p></p>
			<p><p>Audi recommends having all work
on tires or wheels performed by
an authorized Audi dealer or authorized
Audi Service Facility.</p>
<p>
These facilities have the proper
knowledge and are equipped with
the required tools and replacement
parts.</p>
<ul>
	<li>New tires do not yet have the
	optimal gripping properties.<p>
	Drive carefully and at moderate
	speeds for the first 350 miles
	(500 km) with new tires.</p></li>
	<li>Only use tires with the same design,
	size (rolling circumference),
	and as close to the same
	tread pattern as possible on all
	four wheels.</li>
	<li>Do not replace tires individually.<p>
	At least replace both tires on the
	same axle at the same time.</p></li>
	<li>Audi recommends using Audi
	Genuine Tires. If you would like
	to use different tires, please
	note that the tires may perform differently even if they are the
	same size.</li>
	<li>If you would like to equip your
	vehicle with a tire and rim combination
	that is different from
	what was installed at the factory,
	consult with an authorized
	Audi dealer or authorized Audi
	Service Facility before making a
	purchase.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the spare tire is different
from the regular tires installed
on the vehicle (such as winter
tires or wide tires), only use the
spare tire* temporarily in case of
emergency and drive carefully
while it is in use. It should be replaced
with a regular tire as soon
as possible.</p>
<p>Applies to: vehicles with all wheel
drive: All four wheels must be
equipped with tires that are the
same brand and have the same
construction and tread pattern so
that the drive system is not damaged
by different wheel speeds.</p>
<p>
For this reason, in case of emergency,
only use a spare tire* that
is the same circumference as the
regular tires.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><u><strong>Do not use steel rims that are
	17 inches or larger. Otherwise,
	damage to the vehicle and an
	accident could result.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Only use tire/rim combinations
	and suitable wheel bolts
	that have been approved by
	Audi. Otherwise, damage to
	the vehicle and an accident
	could result.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>For technical reasons, it is not
	possible to use tires from other
	vehicles. In some cases, you
	cannot even use tires from the
	same vehicle model.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Make sure that the tires you
	select have enough clearance
	to the vehicle. Replacement
	tires should not be chosen
	simply based on the nominal
	size, because tires with a different
	construction can differ
	greatly even if they are the
	same size. If there is not
	enough clearance, the tires or
	the vehicle can be damaged
	and this can reduce driving
	safety and increase the risk of
	an accident.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Only use tires that are more
	than six years old when absolutely
	necessary and drive
	carefully when doing so.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Do not use run-flat tires on
	your vehicle. Using them when
	not permitted can lead to vehicle
	damage or accidents.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>If you install wheel covers on
	the vehicle, make sure they allow
	enough air circulation to
	cool the brake system. If they
	do not, this could increase the
	risk of an accident.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Mounting a tire on the rim incorrectly
	can result in tire
	damage or failure. To reduce
	the risk of an accident, only
	trained personnel may mount
	a tire on the rim.</strong></u></li>
</ul>
<p><u><strong>Tire wear and damage</strong></u></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/books/1816/index.105(1).png" alt="Wheels"><br>
<strong>Fig. 165 Tire profile: treadwear indicator</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tire wear</strong></p>
<p>Check the tires regularly for wear.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Inflation pressure that is too low
	or high can increase tire wear
	considerably.</li>
	<li>Driving quickly through curves,
	rapid acceleration, and heavy
	braking increase tire wear.</li>
	<li>Have an authorized Audi dealer
	or authorized Audi Service Facility
	check the wheel alignment if
	there is unusual wear.</li>
	<li>Have the wheels rebalanced if an
	imbalance is causing noticeable
	vibration in the steering wheel.<p>
	If you do not, the tires and other
	vehicle components could wear
	more quickly.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treadwear indicator</strong></p>
<p>Original equipment tires contain
treadwear indicators in the tread
pattern, which are bars that are
1/16 inch (1.6 mm) high and are
spaced evenly around the tire perpendicular
to the running direction
&gt; fig. 165. The letters "TWI"
or triangles on the tire sidewall
indicate the location of the treadwear
indicators.</p>
<p>The tires have reached the minimum
tread depth when they
have worn down to the treadwear
indicators. Replace the tires with
new ones.</p>
<p><strong>Tire rotation</strong></p>
<p>Rotating the tires regularly is recommended
to ensure the tires
wear evenly. To rotate the tires,
install the tires from the rear axle
on the front axle and vice versa.</p>
<p>
This will allow the tires to have
approximately the same length of
service life.</p>
<p>
For unidirectional tires, make
sure the tires are installed according
to the running direction indicated
on the tire sidewall.</p>
<p><strong>Hidden damage</strong></p>
<p>Damage to tires and rims can often
occur in locations that are
hidden. Unusual vibrations in the
vehicle or pulling to one side may
indicate that there is tire damage.</p>
<p>
Reduce your speed immediately.</p>
<p>
Check the tires for damage. If no
damage is visible from the outside, drive slowly and carefully to
the nearest authorized Audi dealer
or authorized Audi Service Facility
to have the vehicle inspected.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Tread that has worn too low or
uneven tread depths on the
tires can reduce driving safety.</u></strong></p><strong><u>
</u></strong><p><strong><u>
This can increase the risk of an
accident because it has a negative
effect on handling, driving
through curves, and braking,
and because it increases the
risk of hydroplaning when driving through deep puddles.</u></strong></p>
<p><u><strong>Tire pressure</strong></u></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/books/1816/index.106(1).png" alt="Wheels"><br>
<strong>Fig. 166 Driver's side B-pillar: tire pressure
label</strong></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/books/1816/index.107(1).png" alt="Wheels"><br>
<strong>Fig. 167 Tire pressure label</strong></p>
<p>The correct tire pressure for tires
installed at the factory is listed on
a label. The label is located on the
B-pillar (driver's side) &gt; fig. 166,
&gt; fig. 167. The location may vary
depending on the model.</p>
<p>
Use the tire pressure specified for
a normal vehicle load when the
vehicle is partially loaded &gt; table. If driving the vehicle
when fully loaded, you must increase
the tire pressure to the
maximum specified pressure.</p>
<p><strong>Checking and correcting tire
pressure</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Check the tire pressure at least
	once per month and also check it
	before every long drive.</li>
	<li>Always check the tire pressure
	when the tires are cold. Do not
	reduce the pressure if it increases
	when the tires are warm.</li>
	<li>Refer to the sticker &gt; fig. 167
	for the correct tire pressure.</li>
	<li>Correct the tire pressure if necessary.</li>
	<li>Save the changed tire pressure.</li>
	<li>Check the pressure in the spare
	tire (compact spare tire)*. Always
	maintain the maximum
	temperature that is specified for
	the tire.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Always adapt the tire pressure
to your driving style and the vehicle
load.</u></strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong><u>Overloading can lead to loss of
	vehicle control and increase
	the risk of an accident. Read
	and follow the important safety
	precautions.</u></strong></li>
	<li><strong><u>The tire must flex more if the
	tire pressure is too low or if
	the vehicle speed or load are too high. This heats the tire up
	too much. This increases the
	risk of an accident because it
	can cause the tire to burst and
	result in loss of vehicle control.</u></strong></li>
	<li><strong><u>Incorrect tire pressure increases
	tire wear and has a negative
	effect on driving and braking behavior, which increases the
	risk of an accident.</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p><em>Replace lost valve caps to reduce
the risk of damage to the
tire valves.</em></p>
<p><strong>For the sake of the environment</strong></p>
<p><u>Tire pressure that is too low increases
fuel consumption.</u></p>
<p><u><strong>Tire pressure table</strong></u></p>
<p>Please note that the information
contained in the following table
was correct at the time of printing,
and the information is subject
to change. If there are any
differences, you should always
follow the tire pressure sticker
fig. 166.</p>
<p>Make sure that the tire designation
on your tire matches the designation
on the tire pressure label
and the tire pressure table.</p>
<p>
The following table lists recommended
tire pressures in cold
tires according to the load and
the size of the tires installed.</p>
