			<p><p><u><strong>If the engine oil level too low</strong></u></p>
<p>If you need to add engine oil, use an oil that is listed on the sticker. The 
sticker is located at the front of the engine compartment fig. 158. When using 
the engine oil listed on the sticker, you can adjust the oil level as often as 
needed.</p>
<p>If engine oil that meets the recommended specification is not available, in 
an emergency you may add a maximum of 0.5 quart (0.5 liter) of ACEA C3 or API SN 
engine oil one time until the next oil change.</p>
<p>Audi recommends having the oil changed by an
authorized Audi dealer or authorized Audi Service
Facility.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p><em>Audi recommends using approved engine oil
that meets the respective VW standard. Using
engine oils which do not meet these quality
standards can cause damage to the engine.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
<p><em>Audi recommends using engine oils provided
by Audi Genuine Parts.</em></p>
<p><strong>Messages</strong></p>
<p>The following messages may appear depending
on the vehicle equipment:</p>

<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
<p><em>The oil pressure warning <img border="0" src="images/books/1816/index.40(7).png"> is 
not an oil level
indicator. Always check the oil level regularly.</em></p>
<p><u><strong>Checking the engine oil level</strong></u></p>
<p><em>The engine oil level can be checked in the MMI.</em></p>
<p>Observe the safety precautions General
information.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Park the vehicle on a level surface.</li>
	<li>Shut the engine off when it is warm.</li>
	<li>Switch only the ignition back on.</li>
	<li>Wait approximately five minutes so that the engine
	oil can flow back into the engine oil pan.</li>
	<li>Applies to MMI: Select on the home screen: VEHICLE</li>
	<li>Settings &amp; Service &gt; Oil level.</li>
	<li>Read the oil level in the display. Add engine oil
	if the bar in the oil level indicator is just below
	"min".</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p><em>If the engine oil level is too low or too high,
there is a risk of engine damage.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
<p><em>The oil level indicator in the display is only an
informational display. If the oil level is too
low, a minimum oil warning appears in the instrument
cluster. Add oil and close the hood.</em></p><em>
</em><p><em>
The current oil level will be displayed on the
MMI the next time the ignition is switched on.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
<p><em>The engine oil consumption may be up to
0.5 quart/600 miles (0.5 liter/1,000 km), depending
on driving style and operating conditions.</em></p><em>
</em><p><em>
Consumption may be higher during the
first 3,000 miles (5,000 km). The engine oil
level must be checked regularly. It is best to
check each time you refuel your vehicle and
before long drives.</em></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Because of the lubrication and cooling of
	the engine, combustion engines consume oil. The oil consumption varies 
	depending
	on the engine and may change during the
	service life of the engine. Engines generally
	consume more oil at the beginning during
	the break-in period. Then oil consumption
	stabilizes after the break-in period.</em></li>
	<li><em>Under normal conditions, oil consumption
	depends on the quality and viscosity of the
	oil, the engine RPM, the climate conditions,
	and the road conditions. The dilution of oil
	from condensation or fuel residue as well as
	the age of the oil also play a role. Because
	engine wear increases with mileage, oil consumption
	will increase again over time until
	it may be necessary to replace worn components.</em></li>
	<li><em>Because all these variables play a role, it is
	not possible to define an oil consumption
	standard. Therefore, the oil level must be
	checked regularly.</em></li>
	<li><em>If you believe that your engine has increased
	its oil consumption, contact an authorized
	Audi dealer or authorized Audi Service Facility
	to determine the cause. Please note
	that an exact oil consumption measurement
	must be done with the necessary care and
	accuracy and may take time. An authorized
	Audi dealer or authorized Audi Service Facility
	is trained in accurately measuring the
	oil consumption.</em></li>

	<li>Applies to: using engine oil that meets the recommended
	specification: Add some more engine
	oil again if necessary</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><u><strong>When adding oil, do not let oil drip onto hot
	engine components. This increases the risk
	of a fire.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>You must close the cap on the oil filler opening
	correctly so that oil does not leak out onto
	the hot engine and exhaust system when
	the engine is running, because this is a fire
	hazard.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Always clean skin thoroughly if it comes into
	contact with engine oil.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Engine oil is poisonous and must be kept out
	of reach of children.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Store the engine oil securely in the original
	container.</strong></u></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Only use high-grade engine oil that explicitly
	meets the Audi oil quality standard for
	your vehicle. Using another oil may cause
	severe vehicle damage.</em></li>
	<li><em>Do not mix any additives with the engine oil.</em><p><em>
	Additives may cause engine damage that is
	not covered by your New Vehicle Limited
	Warranty.</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For the sake of the environment</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><u>Oil should never enter the sewer system or
	come into contact with the ground.</u></li>
	<li><u>Follow the legal regulations in the country
	where you are located when disposing of
	empty oil containers.</u></li>
</ul>
<p><u><strong>Changing engine oil</strong></u></p>
<p><em>Audi recommends having the oil changed at an
authorized Audi dealer or authorized Audi Service
Facility.</em></p>
<p>Observe the safety precautions General
information.</p>
<p>The engine oil must be changed at the intervals
specified in the Warranty &amp; Maintenance Booklet.</p>
<p>
This is very important because the Lubrication
function of the oil gradually declines during regular
vehicle operation.</p>
<p>
The engine oil should be changed more frequently
under certain circumstances. Have the oil
changed more frequently if you often drive short
distances, your vehicle is predominantly in stopand-
go traffic situations, is in very dusty environments,
or is operated for long periods of time in
temperatures below zero.</p>
<p>
Cleansing additives in the oil make fresh oil appear
darker after the engine has run briefly. This
is normal and no reason to change the engine oil
more frequently than recommended.</p>
<p>
Because correctly disposing of engine oil is difficult
and special tools and technical knowledge
are needed for an oil change, Audi recommends
having your engine oil changed by an authorized
Audi dealer or authorized Audi Service Facility.</p>
<p>If you change the engine oil yourself, please note
the following important information:</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p><u><strong>If you change the engine oil on the vehicle
yourself, the following precautions must be
followed:</strong></u></p>
<ul>
	<li><u><strong>Wear protective eyewear.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Due to the risk of scalding, allow the engine
	to cool down sufficiently.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Maintain enough distance when you are removing
	the oil drain plug. While doing this,
	keep your forearm parallel to the ground to
	reduce the risk of hot oil dripping down your
	arm.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Drain the oil into a container designed for
	this purpose that is large enough to hold the
	full amount of oil in your engine.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Engine oil is poisonous. Always store out of
	reach of children.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Prolonged contact of used engine oil with
	the skin may cause skin damage. Always
	wash oil off immediately with soap and water
	to protect your skin.</strong></u></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p><em>Do not mix any additives with the engine oil.</em></p><em>
</em><p><em>
Additives may cause engine damage that is
not covered by your New Vehicle Limited Warranty.</em></p>
<p><strong>For the sake of the environment</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><u>Before changing the engine oil, make sure
	you can dispose of the used engine oil correctly.</u></li>
	<li><u>Engine oil must always be disposed of correctly.</u><p>
	<u>Do not dump it in the yard, in the forest,
	or in open water, river channels, or sewers.</u></p></li>
	<li><u>Have your used engine oil recycled by bringing
	it to a used oil collection site or contact
	a gas station.</u></li>
