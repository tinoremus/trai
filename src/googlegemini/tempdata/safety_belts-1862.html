						<p></p>
			<p><p><u><strong>General information</strong></u></p>
<p>Each seat is equipped with a three-point safety
belt. Safety belts that are worn correctly are the
most effective way to reduce the risk of serious or
fatal injuries in a collision. Therefore, wear your
safety belt correctly and make sure that all vehicle
passengers are also wearing their safety belts
correctly when the vehicle is moving.</p>
<p>
Even though your vehicle is equipped with an airbag
system, every vehicle passenger must still always
wear the appropriate safety belt. In addition
to their normal protective function, safety belts
also hold vehicle occupants in the correct seating
position in the event of a collision so that the airbags
can deploy correctly and provide additional
protection. Safety belts provide protection during
collisions when the airbags do not deploy or if
they have already deployed.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>The risk of serious or fatal injury increases if
the safety belt is not fastened, if it is worn incorrectly,
or if it is damaged.</u></strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong><u>All vehicle occupants, including the driver,
	must fasten their safety belts correctly before
	every trip and must always keep their
	safety belts fastened during the trip, regardless
	of whether the seat is equipped
	with an airbag or not. This also applies to children that are seated in a 
	child safety
	seat that is appropriate for their weight and
	age and that is secured with a safety belt.</u></strong></li>
	<li><strong><u>In the event of a collision, vehicle occupants
	that are not wearing safety belts could be
	propelled through the vehicle interior and
	collide with vehicle components, such as the
	steering wheel, instrument panel, windshield,
	or doors. In some situations, vehicle
	occupants could also be ejected from the vehicle.</u></strong></li>
	<li><strong><u>Vehicle occupants in the rear seats
	who do not wear safety belts not only endanger
	themselves, but also other people in
	the vehicle.</u></strong></li>
	<li><strong><u>Only one person may be fastened with a
	safety belt at a time. Never secure more
	than one person, including children, with a
	single safety belt.</u></strong></li>
	<li><u><strong>Never allow children or infants to ride on another
	person's lap and be belted into the
	safety belt with them.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Insert the belt buckle only in the belt latch
	belonging to the corresponding seat, so that
	the protective function is not impaired.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>To ensure the maximum protective function
	of the safety belts, all vehicle passengers
	must sit in the correct seating position.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Check the condition of your vehicle's safety
	belts regularly. If you find damage
	to the belt webbing, the belt connections,
	the retractor, or the buckle, have the
	damaged safety belt replaced by an authorized
	Audi dealer or authorized Audi Service
	Facility.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>The safety belts must not be removed or
	modified in any way. Do not attempt to repair
	the safety belts yourself.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Safety belts that are strained during an accident
	must be replaced by an authorized
	Audi dealer or authorized Audi Service Facility.</strong></u></li>
</ul>
<p><u><strong>Correct safety belt positioning</strong></u></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/books/1816/index.60(3).png" alt="Sitting correctly and safely"><br>
<strong>Fig. 64 Lap/shoulder belt positioning</strong></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/books/1816/index.61(3).png" alt="Sitting correctly and safely"><br>
<strong>Fig. 65 Safety belt positioning for pregnant women</strong></p>
<p>Fastened safety belts only offer optimal protection
during an accident and reduce the risk of serious
injury or death when they are positioned
correctly. Furthermore, the correct safety belt
position holds the vehicle occupant in place so
that a deployed airbag can provide maximum
protection. Therefore, always fasten the safety
belt and make sure it is positioned correctly &gt; fig. 64.</p>
<p>To ensure the safety belt is positioned correctly,
make sure of the following points:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The lap portion of the safety belt must be located
	across the lap.</li>
	<li>The shoulder portion of the safety belt must
	rest over the center of the shoulder.</li>
	<li>The safety belt must always rest flat and securely
	on the body.</li>
</ul>
<p>For pregnant women, the safety belt must rest
evenly across the chest and as low and flat as
possible on the lap, so that no pressure is applied
to the lower abdomen. This should be done
throughout the entire pregnancy &gt; fig. 65.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p><u><strong>Incorrect safety belt positioning can cause serious
injury in the event of an accident or during
sudden braking or driving maneuvers.</strong></u></p>
<ul>
	<li><u><strong>Never drive with the backrest reclined extremely
	far. The more the backrest is tilted
	back, the greater the risk of injury due to the
	safety belt being routed incorrectly.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>The safety belt itself or a loose safety belt
	can cause serious injuries if it shifts onto
	soft areas of the body, such as the stomach.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>The shoulder portion of the safety belt must
	lie over the center of the shoulder and
	chest, and never under the arm, behind the
	back, or across the neck or face.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>The lap portion of the safety belt must lie
	across the lap and never over the stomach.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>The safety belt must lie flat and securely on
	the upper part of the body and the lap.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>The belt webbing must not be pinched or
	twisted, or rub against sharp edges.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>If the safety belt height is set incorrectly
	and/or the safety belt is routed incorrectly,
	then the safety belt's protective function
	will be impaired in the event of an accident.</strong></u><p><u><strong>
	Make sure the safety belt is at the right
	height and is routed correctly for the passenger
	using it.</strong></u></p></li>
	<li><u><strong>A safety belt that is too loose may lead to injuries
	during an accident, because your body
	will move farther forward due to kinetic energy
	and will be stopped abruptly by the
	belt.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Heavily bulky, loose clothing (for example, a
	coat over a sports jacket) may prevent the
	seat and safety belts from functioning correctly.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Do not position the safety belt over hard or
	breakable objects (such as glasses, pens,
	etc.).</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>The lap belt portion of the safety belt must
	sit as low as possible on the lap of pregnant women and lie flat under the 
	belly.</strong></u></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p><em>Make sure that there are no hook-and-loop
fasteners or sharp objects such as zippers or rivets on clothing in the area 
where the safety
belt is worn. Otherwise, the safety belt could
be damaged.</em></p>
<p><u><strong>Fastening and unfastening safety belts</strong></u></p>

<strong>Fig. 67 Releasing the belt buckle from the belt latch</strong></p>
<p>Observe the safety precautions.</p>
<p><strong>Fastening the safety belt</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Pull the safety belt by the belt buckle evenly
	across your chest and lap.</li>
	<li>Insert the belt buckle in the belt latch belonging
	to the seat until it audibly engages
	&gt; fig. 66.</li>
	<li>Pull on the belt to make sure that the belt is securely
	locked in the latch.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unfastening the safety belt</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Press the red button on the belt latch &gt; fig. 67.<p>
	The belt buckle will pop out.</p></li>
	<li>Guide the belt back by hand so that the safety
	belt can roll up more easily.</li>
</ul>
<p><u><strong>Safety belt monitoring system</strong></u></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/books/1816/index.86(2).png"> - If the indicator light turns 
on or flashes, a
front safety belt is not fastened or it has been unfastened while driving. There 
may be additional
audible warning signals.</p>
<p><u><strong>Adjusting the height of the safety belt</strong></u></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/books/1816/index.64(3).png" alt="Sitting correctly and safely"><br>
<strong>Fig. 68 Belt height adjustment for the front seats - safety
belt relay</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>To move the belt higher, slide the safety belt relay
	(2) upward.</li>
	<li>To move the belt lower, press the release button
	(1) and slide the safety belt relay (2) downward.</li>
	<li>To check if the safety belt relay is securely
	locked in place, pull firmly on the belt.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
<p><em>You can also adjust the height of the front
seats to change the position of the safety
belts.</em></p>
<p><u><strong>Additional safety belt functions</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Belt retractor lock</strong></p>
<p>The safety belts on the rear seats and on the
front passenger seat are equipped with a belt retractor
lock.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you secure a child safety seat with a safety
	belt, the belt retractor lock on the safety belt
	may need to be activated. Follow the instructions
	from the child safety seat manufacturer.</li>
	<li>When a vehicle passenger has fastened a safety
	belt, the belt retractor lock should not be activated.<p>
	If the belt retractor lock has been activated
	unexpectedly, deactivate it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Deactivating or activating the belt retractor lock.</p>
<p><strong>Safety belt retractor</strong></p>
<p>The safety belts are equipped with an automatic
belt retractor. This automatic retractor allows the
safety belt to be pulled all the way out when the
belt is pulled slowly. However, the automatic retractor
locks during sudden braking maneuvers.</p>
<p>
It also locks the belts when accelerating, driving
uphill, and driving around curves.</p>
<p><strong>Belt force limiter</strong></p>
<p>Safety belts with belt force limiters reduce the
force placed on the body by the safety belts during
a collision.</p>
<p><strong>Safety belt pretensioners</strong></p>
<p>In certain driving situations, safety belts may be
tightened with reversible belt tensioners when
you start driving. If the safety belt is too loose, it
will be tightened so that the belt will rest closer
to the body.</p>
<p>
In some collisions, pyrotechnic belt tensioners
may secure the safety belts so that they cannot
loosen. This reduces forward movement by the
vehicle passengers.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>The pyrotechnic system can only provide protection
during one collision. If the pyrotechnic
belt tensioners deploy, the pretensioning system
must be replaced by an authorized Audi
dealer or authorized Audi Service Facility.</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
<p><em>Smoke may be released when pyrotechnic belt
tensioners deploy. This is not a sign of a vehicle
fire.</em></p>
<p><strong>Memory function</strong></p>
<p><u><strong>General information</strong></u></p>
<p><em>Applies to: vehicles with memory function</em></p>
<p>With the memory function, you can save and call
up seat profiles using the memory buttons in the
door trim panel.</p>
<p>Depending on vehicle equipment, some settings
such as the driver's seat and exterior mirror position
can be stored.</p>
