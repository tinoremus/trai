			<p><p><u><strong>General information</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><u><strong>If you have not fastened your safety belt,
	you are in an incorrect seating position, or
	you are too close to the airbag system, the
	airbag system will not be able to protect
	you. This increases the risk of serious or fatal
	injuries. Make sure that every vehicle
	passenger has their safety belt correctly fastened
	and is sitting in a correct seating position. This is necessary regardless 
	of whether the seat is equipped with an airbag
	or not.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Never place your feet on the instrument
	panel, out of the window, or on the seat surfaces.</strong></u><p><u><strong>
	To help ensure that the airbag system
	can deploy correctly, never bend forward or
	lean on the door or the side window. Otherwise,
	serious and possibly fatal injuries can
	occur if the airbags deploy.</strong></u></p></li>
	<li><u><strong>People, animals, or objects between the
	passengers and the airbag system can interfere
	with the correct deployment of the airbag
	or can be thrown through the vehicle interior,
	increasing the risk of serious or fatal
	injuries. Make sure that nothing is located
	between the vehicle occupants and the airbag
	system. Do not secure or transport any
	objects within the deployment zone of the
	airbag systems, especially on the steering
	wheel, on the instrument panel, on the
	doors, on the windows, or in the footwell.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Never put stickers on the airbag system covers
	or cover them with any objects.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Only lightweight clothing should be hung
	from the garment hooks in the vehicle. Do
	not use clothes hangers to hang clothing.</strong></u><p><u><strong>
	The pockets of the clothing must not contain
	any heavy, breakable, or sharp-edged
	objects. This could impair the effectiveness
	of the side curtain airbags.</strong></u></p></li>
	<li><u><strong>You must not use seat or protective covers
	that are not specifically approved for use on
	Audi seats with side airbags. Since the side
	airbags deploy from the seat backrest, such
	covers could impair the protective function
	of the side airbags.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Damage to the original seat covers in the
	airbag deployment area must always be repaired
	by an authorized Audi dealer or authorized
	Audi Service Facility.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Airbag system components are installed at
	various locations in your vehicle. Incorrect
	work or repairs on the vehicle could damage
	the airbag system components or impair
	their functionality. This may prevent the airbags
	from deploying or cause them to deploy
	incorrectly in the event of an accident,
	which increases the risk of serious or fatal injuries. Only have an 
	authorized Audi dealer
	or authorized Audi Service Facility make repairs
	or modifications to a vehicle.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>The airbag system can only provide protection
	during one collision. If there is another
	collision, the airbag system will not deploy
	again. If the airbag system has deployed,
	have it replaced immediately by an authorized
	Audi dealer or authorized Audi Service
	Facility.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Fine dust may appear if the airbags deploy.</strong></u><p><u><strong>
	This is completely normal and does not indicate
	a fire in the vehicle. The fine dust can irritate
	the skin and mucous membranes in
	the eyes and can cause difficulty breathing,
	particularly for individuals who have or have
	had asthma or other health issues that affect
	breathing. Exit the vehicle or open the
	windows or doors to get access to fresh air.</strong></u></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
<p><em>If you are transporting children in the vehicle,
read the information and follow the safety
precautions.</em></p>
<p><u><strong>Safety system monitoring</strong></u></p>
<p>The <img border="0" src="images/books/1816/index.87(2).png"> indicator light in the 
instrument cluster
monitors the safety systems such as the airbags
(including the control modules, sensor, and wiring)
and the belt tensioners. It turns on when you
switch the ignition on and turns off after several
seconds.</p>
<p>
If the indicator light does not turn on when the
ignition is switched on, does not turn off after
several seconds, or turns on or flashes while driving,
there may be a malfunction in one of the
safety systems. Drive to an authorized Audi dealer
or authorized Audi Service Facility immediately
to have the malfunction corrected.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p><strong>Have the malfunction in the safety systems inspected
immediately. Otherwise, there is a
risk that the systems may not activate during
an accident, which increases the risk of serious
or fatal injury.</strong></p>
<p><u><strong>Description</strong></u></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/books/1816/index.65(3).png" alt="Sitting correctly and safely"><br>
<strong>Fig. 69 Airbag overview image (enlarged section: deployed airbags)</strong></p>
<p>The locations of the airbags are labeled with
"AIRBAG". The following airbags are installed in
your vehicle:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Driver's airbag</li>
	<li>Front passenger's airbag</li>
	<li>Front side airbags and rear, if applicable</li>
	<li>Head curtain airbag with ejection mitigation</li>
	<li>Knee airbags</li>
</ol>
<p>Airbags offer the best possible protection in your
vehicle during an accident when they are used together
with safety belts that are fastened correctly,
and when passengers are sitting in the
correct seating position. Airbags are a supplementary
restraint system and do not replace
safety belts.</p>
<p>
Airbags may deploy during front-impact, side-impact,
or rollover accidents.</p>
<p>
The deployment area for the airbag system cannot
be defined for every situation, since the circumstances
surrounding accidents can vary widely.</p>
<p>
Factors that play an important role include the
Fig. 69 Airbag overview image (enlarged section: deployed airbags)
condition of the object that the vehicle hits (hard
or soft), the angle of impact, vehicle speed, etc.</p>
<p>
The deciding factor for the deployment of the airbag
system is the deceleration that occurs during
an accident. Sensors in the vehicle are designed
to detect the severity of an accident in conjunction
with the control module, and to provide a
targeted and timely deployment of the restraint
system. If the vehicle deceleration that is measured
during an accident is below the specified
reference values in the control module, then the
airbags will not deploy, even though the vehicle
may be severely damaged from the accident. In
these cases, the vehicle occupants will be protected
by the safety belts if they are fastened and
worn correctly.</p>
<p>
The deployment of the front passenger's airbag
will depend on the occupancy of the seat.</p>
<p>Each deployed airbag is filled with gas. When this
occurs, the airbag covers open and the airbags
unfold with great force into the deployment zone within milliseconds. Inflated 
airbags reduce the
movement of passengers wearing safety belts in
the direction of the impact and thus help to reduce
the risk of injury. They can help to protect
the head, upper body, and lap, for example. However,
there is the possibility that airbag deployment
can cause injuries.</p>
<p>
The airbag system only works when the ignition
is turned on.</p>
<p>
If you or other vehicle passengers have physical
limitations that prevent sitting in a correct position,
modifications to the vehicle may be necessary.</p>
<p>

Audi dealer or authorized Audi Service Facility,

1-800-822-2834.</p>
<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
<p><em>The side curtain airbags in your vehicle have
ejection mitigation functions. This reduces
the risk of being ejected from the vehicle interior
during an accident, especially in the event
of a vehicle rollover.</em></p><ul></ul></table></ul><div style="clear:both"></div><div align="center"></div><h2 style="border-top:1px solid #222; padding-top:15px; margin-top: 15px;">READ NEXT:</h2>
