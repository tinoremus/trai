			<p><p><strong>Vehicles with a high-voltage system (hybrid vehicles)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Extremely Dangerous Due to High-Voltage</strong></p>
<p>The high-voltage system is under high-voltage. Death or serious 
bodily injury by electric shock.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Individuals with electronic/medical life- and health sustaining 
machines in or on their person cannot perform any work on high-voltage 
systems. Life- and health sustaining machines are for example pain 
killer pumps, implanted defibrillators, pacemakers, insulin pumps, and 
hearing aids.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Have the high-voltage system de-energized by a qualified person.</p>
<p><strong>There is a Risk of Injury from the Engine Starting Unexpectedly</strong></p>
<p>On electric - hybrid vehicles an active ready mode is difficult to 
identify. Parts of the body can be clamped or pulled.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Turn off the ignition.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Place the ignition key outside of the vehicle interior.</p>
<p><strong>Risk of Damaging the High-Voltage Cables</strong></p>
<p>Misuse can damage the insulation of high-voltage cables or 
high-voltage connectors.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Never support objects on the high-voltage cables and the 
high-voltage connectors.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Never support tools on the high-voltage cables and the high-voltage 
connectors.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Never sharply bend or kink the high-voltage cables.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;When connecting pay attention to the coding of the high-voltage 
connectors.</p>
<ul>
	<li>For all procedures on vehicles with high-voltage system pay 
attention to the additional warning message for these vehicles. 
Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Warnings when Working on Vehicles with High Voltage 
System".</li>
	<li>If procedures are necessary near components of the 
high-voltage system "perform a visual inspection of the damage 
of the high-voltage components and lines". Refer to
→&nbsp;Chapter "Performing a Visual Inspection of Damage to High 
Voltage Components and Cables".</li>
	<li>If work on the components of the high-voltage system is 
necessity, de-energize the high-voltage system. Refer to
→&nbsp;Rep. Gr.93;&nbsp;High-Voltage System, De-Energizing or
→&nbsp;Electrical Equipment;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.93;&nbsp;High-Voltage System, 
De-Energizing.</li>
</ul>
<p>-&nbsp;Charge the vehicle battery, for example, using the Battery 
Charger -VAS5904- in the battery support mode to minimize the 
number of automatic starts during the test- and measuring 
procedures while the ready mode is active. Refer to
→&nbsp;Electrical Equipment General Information;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.27;&nbsp;Battery; 
Charging the Battery and 
→&nbsp;Electrical Equipment;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.93;&nbsp;General Notes for Working on 
the High Voltage System.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Move the selector level into position "P", activate the 
parking brake and arrange the necessary tools for testing and 
measuring procedures that require the ready mode to be active or 
that require the ignition to be on, so that they cannot come 
into contact with the turning components in the engine and so 
that they are not in the vicinity of the turning components of a 
running engine.</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Also move the selector lever into position "P" and activate 
the parking brake for testing and measuring procedures which 
require the ignition to be on, but do not require the ready mode 
to be active.</em></li>
	<li><em>The ready mode is displayed in the Instrument Cluster 
Control Module -J285- above the "powermeter". Refer to Owner's 
Manual.</em></li>
	<li><em>Activate and deactivate the ready mode. Refer to Owner's 
Manual (consult the display in the Instrument Cluster Control 
Module -J285-).</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Vehicles with Start/Stop System</strong></p>
<p><strong>There is a Risk of Injury from the Engine Starting Unexpectedly</strong></p>
<p>The engine can start unexpectedly on vehicles with an activated 
Start/Stop System. A message appears in the instrument cluster 
indicating whether the Start/Stop System is activated.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Deactivate the Start/Stop System: Turn off the ignition.</p>
<p><strong>All Vehicles</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/Vorsicht.jpg"> 
&nbsp; <strong>Caution</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>If it is suspected that chemicals were added to the 
refrigerant circuit to seal leaks, chemical substances 
to seal leaks in the refrigerant circuit (leak stop 
additive), do not connect the A/C service station and do 
not extract the refrigerant.</em></li>
	<li><em>Chemicals that seal leaks in the coolant circuit 
form deposits that affect the function of the A/C system 
and lead to failure of the A/C system and the A/C 
service station.</em></li>
	<li><em>Inform that customer that there are substances in 
the A/C system that are no approved by Audi.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>The chemical materials (stop leak additive) for sealing 
leaks in the refrigerant circuit offered on the market are not 
approved by Audi AG. There are no permanent- ,validity or 
material compatibility tests. Therefore, damage or malfunctions 
in the A/C system or the A/C Service Station cannot be excluded.</em></li>
	<li><em>The stop leak additives offered on the open market have 
different physical and chemical properties, which can impair the 
function of the A/C system and the A/C Service Station and can 
even shut down the system completely.</em></li>
	<li><em>Audi does not approve the use of chemicals to seal leaks in 
the refrigerant circuit (leak stop additives).</em></li>
	<li><em>Chemical materials (leak stop additives) to seal leaks in 
the refrigerant circuit react with air or the moisture in the 
air and form deposits in the refrigerant circuit (and in the A/C 
service station) that lead to malfunctions in the valves and 
other components that come into contact with such chemicals. 
These deposits cannot be removed completely from the components 
(also not through cleaning/flushing with refrigerant R134a).</em></li>
	<li><em>It is not possible to recognize chemical substances to seal 
leaks in the refrigerant circuit (leak stop additive) and the 
label that is supposed to come with them is usually not there. 
Therefore be careful when working with if you do not know its 
service history.</em></li>
	<li><em>Accessories offer containers used to separate out these 
chemicals (used to seal leaks in the refrigerant circuit). Since 
Audi does not know composition and the physical and chemical 
properties of these materials, it is not possible to make a 
statement about their effectiveness and the deposition rate of 
these filters.</em></li>
	<li><em>The Filter for Sealants -VAS6592- offers a certain 
protection for the A/C service station. This filter is 
incorporated between the A/C service station and the Service 
connection on the low pressure side of the refrigerant circuit 
in a vehicle (the A/C service station may not be connection to 
the service connection of the high pressure side of the 
refrigerant circuit for draining, evacuating and measuring). 
This filter separate certain materials that were added to seal 
leaks in the refrigerant circuit. It prevents these materials 
from getting into the refrigerant and refrigerant oil in the A/C 
service station unchecked and doing damage. For the protection 
to work, it is necessary that the filter be changed in regular 
intervals and exactly according to the manufacturer 
specifications (described in the instructions provided). Audi 
does not support using chemical materials (stop leak additives) 
for sealing leaks in the refrigerant circuit. There are many 
different formulas of these chemicals (stop leak additives), 
that are offered as "sealant for refrigerant circuits" and it is 
not possible to make a statement about the effectiveness of the 
Filter for Sealants -VAS6592-.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If the refrigerant circuit gets filed with a chemical 
material (stop leak additive) to seal any leaks (or if there is 
a suspicion of this) and if it then necessary to perform a 
repair to the refrigerant circuit, then it is necessary to 
inform the customer of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It is not possible to evacuate the refrigerant from the A/C 
system due to the stop leak additive that has been added to the 
system because it will damage the A/C Service Station. It will 
necessary to hire an outside company the can evacuate the 
contaminated refrigerant with a suitable device and then dispose 
of it (for example, a local waste management company that 
specializes in disposing of refrigerant).</li>
	<li>It will be necessary to replace any refrigerant circuit 
components that have come in contact with the stop leak additive 
in order to repair the A/C system properly. Certain refrigerant 
circuit components may already be damaged by the stop leak 
additive (for example, the A/C Compressor Regulator Valve 
-N280-) or will get damaged if they are used over again and will 
fail after a short amount of time. In addition to this, if there 
is any sediment from the stop leak additive still in the 
circuit, it could come loose at a later point and cause the A/C 
system to fail again (currently it is not possible to clean 
these components with any workshop tools).</li>
