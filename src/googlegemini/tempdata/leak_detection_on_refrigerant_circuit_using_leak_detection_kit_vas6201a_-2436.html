			<p><p><strong>Vehicles with a High Voltage System (Hybrid Vehicles)</strong></p>
<p>Read and follow all of the supplemental warnings for all 
work performed on vehicles with the high voltage system. Refer 
to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Warnings when Working on Vehicles with High Voltage 
System" and 
→&nbsp;Electrical Equipment;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.93;&nbsp;General Warnings when 
Working on High Voltage System.</p>
<p><strong>All vehicles</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Certain leaks cannot or only with difficulty be found using 
an electric leak detection unit. Leak detection can be performed 
using Leak Detection Kit -VAS6201A-.</em></li>
	<li><em>Refrigerant and refrigerant oil escape when there is a leak 
in the refrigerant circuit. Generally, this oil remains in the 
vicinity of the leaking area. A small amount of fluorescent 
fluid must be added into refrigerant circuit so that this oil 
becomes visible under UV light. This fluid (PAG oil with an 
additive that lights up under UV light) is added into the 
refrigerant circuit and distributes itself with the refrigerant 
oil when the A/C system is switched on.</em></li>
	<li><em>A/C system must be operated for a minimum of 60 minutes so 
that the additive distributes itself in the entire refrigerant 
circuit (compressor must be running). Depending on the size of 
the leak, it may become visible under UV light within that time.</em></li>
	<li><em>Refrigerant oil with additive that lights up under UV-light 
can be added directly with an open circuit or be pumped into a 
filled circuit via service connection on the low pressure side 
using Leak Detection Kit - Hand Pump w/Cartridge -VAS6201/1- 
(from Leak Detection Kit -VAS6201A-).</em></li>
	<li><em>If the UV-leak detection additive is added to a filled 
refrigerant circuit via the service connection on the low 
pressure side, a small amount of it remains in the service 
connection. Carefully remove this residual amount so that a 
leaking area is not detected erroneously upon a later leak 
detection.</em></li>
	<li><em>If a component in which UV-leak detection additive has been 
added is being replaced on a circuit, thoroughly clean the 
connection areas to the other components after assembling the 
refrigerant circuit. The UV-leak detection additive residue may 
register erroneously as leaking areas during later leak 
detection.</em></li>
	<li><em>Refrigerant oil as well as UV-leak detection additive get 
into the service station when evacuating a refrigerant circuit. 
The refrigerant oil is separated from refrigerant in oil 
collector of service station and removed from the service 
station via the draining device. The refrigerant oil drained off 
must not be poured back in. It must be replaced with new 
refrigerant oil.</em></li>
	<li><em>If leak detection fluid was filled already in a refrigerant 
circuit for an earlier repair, note the following: Only add new 
leak detection fluid if the refrigerant oil will be replaced. If 
only a portion of refrigerant oil was replaced, only top-off 
with a corresponding amount of leak detection fluid as well. For 
example, if 100 ml of refrigerant oil was replaced in a vehicle 
with 250 ml, add only 1 ml (cm<sup>3</sup>) of 
UV-leak detection additive.</em></li>
	<li><em>Certain materials and their connections (for example, 
oxidation products on aluminum components, corrosion protection 
growth, etc.) also light up under UV-light.</em></li>
	<li><em>Depending on the version of the A/C service station, UV-leak 
detection additive can also be added directly at the top. Refer 
to the operating instructions that come with the A/C service 
station.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>To prevent more refrigerant than is necessary for the leak 
test from venting into the air, proceed as follows with the 
refrigerant circuit completely empty:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Evacuate the refrigerant circuit with the A/C service 
station. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Refrigerant Circuit, Discharging with Service 
Station".</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>If a larger leak is found during evacuation, find and repair 
it as described. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Finding Leaks via Vacuum Test using A/C Service 
Station or Nitrogen Pressure Testing" and
→&nbsp;Chapter "Refrigerant Circuit, Discharging with Service 
Station".</em></li>
	<li><em>The UV-leak detection additive can also be filled in a filled or open 
refrigerant circuit with the Leak Detection Kit -VAS6201A-. </em> </li>
</ul>
<p>If no leak is found during evacuation or there is a leak 
that is so small that the location cannot be found, proceed as 
follows. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Add the UV-leak detection additive using the A/C service station to the 
refrigerant circuit. </li>
	<li>Add UV-leak detection additive using the Leak Detection Kit -VAS6201- in 
the refrigerant circuit. </li>
</ul>
<p>Add the UV-leak detection additive 
using the A/C service station to the refrigerant circuit.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Add the UV-leak detection additive and the prescribed 
refrigerant amount using the A/C Service Station to the 
refrigerant circuit. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Refrigerant R134a Capacities".</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<p><em>Add 2.5 +- 0.5 cm<sup>3</sup> of UV-leak 
detection additive for a refrigerant circuit with a refrigerant 
capacity of 100 to 150 cm <sup>3</sup> with the 
Leak Detection Kit -VAS6201- for the Leak Detection Kit 
-VAS6201-. If the refrigerant oil capacity in the refrigerant 
circuit is larger, then more UV leak detection additive must be 
added accordingly (for example, 5.0 +- 0.5 cm<sup>3</sup> 
for a refrigerant circuit with a refrigerant oil capacity of 250 
cm <sup>3</sup>. When adding the UV-leak 
detection additive using the A/C service station, consult the

on the refrigerant circuit when A/C is being used (for example, 
on the top cover of the receiver/dryer attached to the condenser 
on an Audi A8 from MY 2010). If there is a leak at this spot, it 
may take longer until enough refrigerant with refrigerant oil 
and additive start to leak out, which then can be viewed under 
UV light. It may be useful to use an electronic leak detector at 
these locations to find a leak. Refer to

<p>-&nbsp;Move vehicle into a slightly darker area of the workshop

diminished).</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Check the accessibility of the various components in the 
refrigerant circuit and remove any components in the area that 
block access to the refrigerant circuit such as noise insulation 
and the bumper.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Wear protective eyewear to protect the eyes.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Connect the UV-lamp to a 12 volt battery (vehicle battery). 
Observe the correct polarity of connections.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Switch on the UV lamp and illuminate the components of 
refrigerant circuit. Locations where refrigerant, refrigerant 
oil and UV-leak detection additive has leaked out light up under 
fluorescent UV light.</p>
