			<p><p><strong>Vehicles with a High Voltage System (Hybrid Vehicles)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Extremely Dangerous Due to High-Voltage</strong></p>
<p>The high-voltage system is under high-voltage. Death or serious 
bodily injury by electric shock.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Individuals with electronic/medical life- and health sustaining 
machines in or on their person cannot perform any work on high-voltage 
systems. Life- and health sustaining machines are for example pain 
killer pumps, implanted defibrillators, pacemakers, insulin pumps, and 
hearing aids.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Have the high-voltage system de-energized by a qualified person.</p>
<p><strong>There is a Risk Of Injury from the Engine Starting Unexpectedly</strong></p>
<p>On electric - hybrid vehicles an active ready mode is difficult to 
identify. Parts of the body can be clamped or pulled.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Turn off the ignition.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Place the ignition key outside of the vehicle interior.</p>
<p><strong>Risk of Damaging the High-Voltage Cables</strong></p>
<p>Misuse can damage the insulation of high-voltage cables or 
high-voltage connectors.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Never support objects on the high-voltage cables and the 
high-voltage connectors.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Never support tools on the high-voltage cables and the high-voltage 
connectors.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Never sharply bend or kink the high-voltage cables.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;When connecting pay attention to the coding of the high-voltage 
connectors.</p>
<ul>
	<li>For all procedures on vehicles with high-voltage system pay 
attention to the additional warning message for these vehicles. 
Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Warnings when Working on Vehicles with High Voltage 
System".</li>
	<li>If procedures are necessary near components of the 
high-voltage system "perform a visual inspection of the damage 
of the high-voltage components and lines". Refer to
→&nbsp;Chapter "Performing a Visual Inspection of Damage to High 
Voltage Components and Cables".</li>
	<li>If work on the components of the high-voltage system is 
necessity, de-energize the high-voltage system. Refer to
→&nbsp;Rep. Gr.93;&nbsp;High-Voltage System, De-Energizing or
→&nbsp;Electrical Equipment;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.93;&nbsp;High-Voltage System, 
De-Energizing.</li>
</ul>
<p>-&nbsp;Charge the vehicle battery, for example, using the Battery 
Charger -VAS5904- in the battery support mode to minimize the 
number of automatic starts during the test- and measuring 
procedures while the ready mode is active. Refer to
→&nbsp;Electrical Equipment General Information;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.27;&nbsp;Battery; 
Charging the Battery and 
→&nbsp;Electrical Equipment;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.93;&nbsp;General Notes for Working on 
the High Voltage System.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Move the selector level into position "P", activate the 
parking brake and arrange the necessary tools for testing and 
measuring procedures that require the ready mode to be active or 
that require the ignition to be on, so that they cannot come 
into contact with the turning components in the engine and so 
that they are not in the vicinity of the turning components of a 
running engine.</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Also move the selector lever into position "P" and activate 
the parking brake for testing and measuring procedures which 
require the ignition to be on, but do not require the ready mode 
to be active.</em></li>
	<li><em>The ready mode is displayed in the Instrument Cluster 
Control Module -J285- above the "powermeter". Refer to Owner's 
Manual.</em></li>
	<li><em>Activate and deactivate the ready mode. Refer to Owner's 
Manual (consult the display in the Instrument Cluster Control 
Module -J285-).</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All vehicles</strong></p>
<p>Compressed air and nitrogen are to be used in order to force 
out moisture and other contaminants as well as old refrigerant 
oil as efficiently as possible, without wasting refrigerant. In 
the refrigerant circuit is to be cleaned (flush with refrigerant 
R134a or blow through with compressed air and nitrogen )</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>For the most part, blowing through the refrigerant circuit 
with compressed air and nitrogen requires significantly more 
work than cleaning (flushing) with refrigerant R134a. As 
cleaning (flushing) with refrigerant R134a cleans the components 
more efficiently, always flush in case of a complaint (blowing 
through should only be used for certain complaints and 
individual components).</em></li>
	<li><em>Under certain conditions it may be sufficient to blow 
through certain components (e.g. individual refrigerant lines or 
refrigerant hoses) with compressed air and nitrogen (e.g. for 
purposes of forcing out old refrigerant oil from individual 
components that were removed).</em></li>
	<li><em>Certain contaminants cannot or can only be insufficiently 
removed from the refrigerant circuit with compressed air, these 
contaminants can be removed, for example by cleaning (flushing) 
with refrigerant R134a. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Refrigerant Circuit, Cleaning (Flushing), with 
Refrigerant R134a".</em></li>
	<li><em>When blowing through, the maximum work pressure of 15 bar 
(217 psi) must not be exceeded (corresponding to pressure that 
is reached in a filled refrigerant circuit with an ambient 
temperature of approximately 60 ºC (140 ºF), if necessary use 
pressure reducer also for compressed air)</em></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/achtung.jpg"> 
&nbsp; <strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em><strong>Nitrogen can leak uncontrolled from the cylinder.</strong></em></li>
	<li><em><strong>Make exclusive use of pressure reducers for nitrogen 
cylinders (maximum work pressure 15 bar (217 psi) ).</strong></em></li>
	<li><em><strong>Use appropriate extraction units to draw off gas 
mixture escaping from components.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>-&nbsp;Always flush components in direction opposite to refrigerant 
flow.</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<p><em>Restrictor, expansion valve, compressor, receiver and 
reservoir cannot be flushed with compressed air and nitrogen.</em></p>
<p>-&nbsp;Remove this dryer cartridge on condensers that have one 
installed in the integrated receiver/dryer.</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>If the receiver/dryer or dryer cartridge is integrated in 
the condenser, then they cannot be replaced separately and the 
condenser must be replaced after cleaning (flushing).</em></li>
	<li><em>Receivers/dryers where it is possible to replace the dryer 
cartridge have an additional filter, which must also be replaced 
with the dryer cartridge.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>-&nbsp;First flush out old refrigerant oil and dirt using 
compressed air and then use nitrogen to remove component 
moisture.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Adapter for sealing off the pressure hose to the refrigerant 
circuit. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "A/C Service Station, Connecting".</p>
<p>Note the following points to prevent oil and moisture from 
entering the refrigerant circuit from the compressed air system.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;The compressed air must be routed through a compressed air 
purifier for cleaning and drying. For this reason use the filter 
and dryer for the compressed air (included in scope of delivery 
as tool for painting work).</p>
<p>-&nbsp;On refrigerant lines with thread or union nut on the 
connection, use the adapter from the A/C Adapter Set -VAG1785- 
(A/C Adapter Set - Adapter 1 -VAG1785/1- through A/C Adapter Set 
- Adapter 8 -VAG1785/8-) to connect charge hoses 5/8" -18 UNF (a 
section of this adapter is also contained in the Refrigerant 
Circuits Adapter Set 1 -VAS6338/1-.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;On refrigerant lines without thread or union nut on the 
connection (for connecting adapters), use adapter from 
Refrigerant Circuits Adapter Set 1 -VAS6338/1- or a standard 
blower pistol with rubber mouthpiece.</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Only blow through refrigerant circuit with compressed air 
and then with nitrogen if there is no possibility of cleaning 
(flushing) the refrigerant circuit with refrigerant R134a or the 
amount of work to flush individual components becomes excessive 
(for example minor contaminants and moisture can also be blown 
out of the refrigerant lines in a short period of time).</em></li>
	<li><em>Compressed air/nitrogen emerging from components is to be 
drawn off by way of an appropriate system (for example, a 
workshop extraction system).</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The circuit (or individual components) must be blown through 
(if there is no possibility for cleaning or flushing with 
refrigerant R134a is not recommended):</p>
<p>-&nbsp;In the event dirt or other contaminants are located in 
individual components of the circuit.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;If vacuum reading is not maintained on evacuating a 
leak-free refrigerant circuit (pressure build-up due to moisture 
in refrigerant circuit).</p>
<p>-&nbsp;The refrigerant circuit has been left open for longer than 
normal (for example, following an accident).</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Pressure and temperature measurements in the refrigerant 
circuit indicate the likelihood of moisture.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;In the event of doubt about the amount of refrigerant oil in 
the circuit.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;The A/C compressor had to be replaced on account of internal 
damage (for example, noise or no output).</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<p><em>Pay attentions when replacing the Electrical A/C Compressor 
-V470- on vehicles with electrically driven A/C compressor (if 
the electronic on the A/C compressor is damaged the refrigerant 
circuit must not always be cleaned. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Compressor, Replacing without the Need for Flushing 
Refrigerant Circuit".</em></p>
<p>-&nbsp;If it is stipulated by the vehicle-specific repair manual 
following the replacement of certain components.</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<p><em>Certain contaminants and old refrigerant oil cannot or can 
only be insufficiently removed from the refrigerant circuit with 
compressed air, these contaminants can be removed, for example, 
by cleaning (flushing) with refrigerant R134a. Refer to
→&nbsp;Chapter "Refrigerant Circuit, Cleaning (Flushing), with 
Refrigerant R134a".</em></p><ul></ul></table></ul><div style="clear:both"></div><div align="center"></div><h2 style="border-top:1px solid #222; padding-top:15px; margin-top: 15px;">READ NEXT:</h2>
