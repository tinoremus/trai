			<p><p><strong>Warranty</strong></p>
<p>Your vehicle is covered by various warranties:</p>
<ul>
	<li>New Vehicle Limited Warranty</li>
	<li>Limited Warranty Against Corrosion Perforation</li>
	<li>Emissions Control System Warranties: Federal
	Emissions Control System Defect Warranty,
	Federal Emissions Performance Warranty</li>

	Warranty, TZEV models Emissions Defects
	Warranty, California Emissions Performance
	Warranty</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find detailed information in your Warranty
&amp; Maintenance Booklet and in the California
Emissions Booklet*.</p>
<p><strong>Audi Literature Shop</strong></p>
<p>Service information is made available as soon as
possible after a model is introduced and can be
ordered in the Audi Literature Shop: http://
literature.audiusa.com</p>
<p><strong>Driving in other
countries</strong></p>
<p>Government regulations in the United States and
Canada require motor vehicles to comply with
emissions regulations and safety standards.</p>
<p>
Therefore, vehicles that were produced for the
U.S. and Canadian markets are different from
vehicles produced for other countries.</p>
<p>
If you plan to use your vehicle outside of the United
States or Canada, it is possible that:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fuel may have a significantly lower octane rating.<p>
	Unsuitable fuels can cause engine damage.</p></li>
	<li>Proper maintenance and repair work may not
	be possible because special service equipment,
	tools, or measuring devices needed for your vehicle
	may not be available.</li>
	<li>Replacement parts may not always be available.</li>
	<li>Navigation systems for vehicles built for the
	U.S.A. and Canada will not necessarily work in
	Europe, and may not work in other countries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p><em>Audi is not liable for damage to the vehicle resulting
from these country-specific differences.</em></p>
<p><strong>Maintenance, repairs,
and technical modifications</strong></p>
<p><strong>General information</strong></p>
<p>Due to the increasing complexity of technology in
these vehicles, as well as the safety and environmental
standards that apply, you can only perform
a very limited amount of repairs and modifications
to the vehicle yourself.</p>
<p>
Proof of maintenance work may be required to
submit a claim within the warranty period.</p>
<p>
We recommend that you have your vehicle serviced
by an authorized Audi dealer or authorized
Audi Service Facility and that Audi Genuine Parts
and Audi Genuine Accessories are used. This
helps to ensure that your vehicle's functionality,
performance, and safety are not impaired.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance and repairs</strong></p>
<p>Your vehicle was designed to help keep maintenance
requirements to a minimum. Some regular
maintenance is required to help ensure that your
vehicle runs in a safe, economical, and reliable
manner. Please refer to your Warranty &amp; Maintenance
Booklet for more detailed information
about vehicle maintenance.</p>
<p>
When operating the vehicle under more extreme
operating conditions, for example when outside
temperatures are very low or in very dusty environments,
certain maintenance should be performed
between the specified intervals.</p>
<p>Usually maintenance and repair work requires
special tools, measuring devices, and other
equipment that is available to trained vehicle
technicians in order to help ensure that your vehicle
and all of its systems operate correctly, reliably,
and safely. Performing work on the vehicle
incorrectly can impair the operation and reliability
of your vehicle and may void one or more of
your vehicle's warranties.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Modifications</strong></p>
<p>Interference with electronic components, their
software, the wiring, and data transfer may cause
malfunctions. Because of the way electronic components
are interconnected, such malfunctions
can also impair systems that are not directly involved.</p>
<p>
This means that you risk both a substantial
reduction in the operational safety of your vehicle
and increased wear of vehicle components.</p>
<p>
Some convenience functions, such as the convenience
turn signal function, individual door opening
function, and displays, can be reprogrammed
using special workshop equipment. If functions
are reprogrammed, the information and descriptions
about these functions in this Owner's Manual
may no longer apply to the changed functions.</p>
<p>
Audi recommends that an authorized Audi
dealer or authorized Audi Service Facility perform
and verify any reprogramming procedures.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Maintenance work, repairs, or technical modifications
to the vehicle (such as installing additional
equipment) that is not performed
correctly can cause serious injuries and increase
the risk of an accident.</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>The motor compartment in any motor vehicle
is a potentially dangerous area and can cause
serious personal injury.</u></strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong><u>Always use extreme caution when doing any
	work in the motor compartment. Always follow
	commonly accepted safety practices and
	use common sense. Never risk personal injury.</u></strong></li>
	<li><u><strong>Never perform any work in the motor compartment
	unless you know exactly how to
	carry out the job and have the correct technical
	information and the correct tools.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>If you are uncertain about what to do, have
	the work performed by an authorized Audi
	dealer, an authorized Audi Service Facility,
	or another qualified workshop. Serious personal
	injury may result from improperly performed
	work.</strong></u></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Maintenance work, repairs, or technical
	modifications to the vehicle (such as installing
	additional equipment) that is not performed
	correctly can cause vehicle damage.</em></li>
	<li><em>The New Vehicle Limited Warranty does not
	cover damage or malfunctions if the recommended
	intended use of the vehicle and
	maintenance measures listed in the Audi
	Owner's Manual and the Warranty &amp; Maintenance
	Booklet were not followed.</em></li>
	<li><em>If emergency repairs must be performed,
	take your vehicle to an authorized Audi dealer
	or authorized Audi Service Facility as soon
	as possible.</em></li>
	<li><em>Audi is not liable for damage to the vehicle
	resulting from failure to comply with these
	guidelines.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For the sake of the environment</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><u>Regular maintenance can help protect the
	environment.</u></li>
	<li><u>Technical modifications to the vehicle can
	have a negative impact on fuel consumption
	and vehicle emissions.</u></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For the sake of the environment</strong></p>
<p><u>Certain components in your vehicle such as
undeployed airbag modules, pretensioners
and remote control batteries may contain Perchlorate
Material - special handling may apply,
See www.dtsc.ca.gov/hazardouswaste/
perchlorate. When the vehicle or parts of the
restraint system including airbag modules
and safety belts with pretensioners are scrapped,
all applicable laws and regulations must be observed. Your authorized Audi 
dealer is
familiar with these requirements and we recommend
that you have your dealer perform
this service for you.</u></p>
<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
<p><em>Because of your vehicle's aluminum body design,
all service and repair procedures affecting
the body should be performed by an authorized
Audi dealer or authorized Audi Service
Facility, who will perform the work according
to Audi factory specifications. Only Audi
Genuine Parts are used when Audi experts
perform repair or service procedures. Failure
to use Audi Genuine Parts or Audi Genuine Accessories
or performing repairs incorrectly
may result in severe vehicle damage, such as
corrosion.</em></p>
<p><strong>Accessories and parts</strong></p>
<p>Consult with an authorized Audi dealer or authorized
Audi Service Facility before purchasing accessories
or replacement parts. Audi recommends
having your vehicle serviced by an authorized
Audi dealer or authorized Audi Service Facility
and using Audi Genuine Parts and Audi Genuine
Accessories.</p>
<p>
Audi does not endorse the use of products and
accessories that it has not evaluated, even if the
product is approved by a certified testing agency
or government agency.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong><u>Installing unapproved accessories or incorrect
	replacement parts can cause vehicle
	damage and can increase the risk of an accident.</u></strong></li>
	<li><strong><u>Never attach accessories, such as telephone
	holders or cup holders, to the airbag covers
	or within the airbag deployment zone, because
	this increases the risk of injury if the
	airbag deploys.</u></strong></li>
	<li><strong><u>On vehicles that have factory-installed license
	plate brackets on the front of the vehicle,
	the brackets may only be replaced
	with ones that are the same size and made
	of the same material. Do not install any license plate brackets on the front 
	of vehicles
	that do not have factory-installed brackets.</u></strong><p><strong><u>
	Otherwise, the function of the system could
	be impaired.</u></strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p><em>A correctly-installed exterior antenna is required
for operating radio equipment in the
vehicle. Otherwise, the increased electromagnetic
waves can cause malfunctions in the vehicle.</em></p><em>
</em><p><em>
Observe the regulations in the country
where the vehicle is being operated and the
instructions from the radio equipment manufacturer.</em></p>
