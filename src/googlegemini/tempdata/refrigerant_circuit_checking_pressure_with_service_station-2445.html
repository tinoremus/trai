<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>All test conditions marked * are vehicle-specific and are 
described in the Repair Manual for the relevant vehicle.</em></li>
	<li><em>Check cooling performance.</em></li>
	<li><em>Connections with valve and service connections for 
measurement and testing. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.87;&nbsp;System 
Overview - Refrigerant Circuit (vehicle-specific 
repair manual).</em></li>
	<li><em>Depending on the A/C compressor version, there may be a 
valve installed on the high pressure side of the A/C compressor, 
which prevents the liquid refrigerant from flowing back into the 
compressor once the A/C is turned off. If an A/C compressor with 
this valve is installed in a vehicle with a refrigerant circuit 
having an expansion valve, then it may take some time until the 
pressure in the high pressure side decreases (the expansion is 
cold and the pressure in the low pressure side quickly increases 
after it is turned off, the expansion valve closes and the 
refrigerant flows slowly into the low pressure side). If the A/C 
compressor is switched on, the pressure on the low pressure side 
goes down, the expansion valve open and the refrigerant can flow 
of the low pressure side.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Under certain operating conditions, residual moisture in 
refrigerant circuit can lead to an ice build-up at A/C 
Compressor Regulator Valve. A/C compressor control is reduced by 
this ice build-up, evaporator is cooled too intensely and 
freezes. The freeze-up of the evaporator can be the cause for 
the following customer complaints:</p>
<ul>
	<li>After a long drive, A/C system repeatedly or sporadically 
fails (no cooling or heating performance). After switching off 
the vehicle and after a short time, A/C function is OK again.</li>
	<li>After a long drive, windows (front/side and rear windows) 
fog up from inside, windows are also not cleared by then 
pressing the Defrost button, after 
switching off vehicle and after a short time, A/C function is OK 
again.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Corrective Action:</strong></p>
<p>-&nbsp;On vehicles as of model year 2001 equipped with a compressor 
with A/C Compressor Regulator Valve -N280-, check measured value 
of evaporator outflow temperature Evaporator Vent Temperature 
Sensor -G263- (via function "Read measuring value block"). Is 
the measured value from the sensor is below the operating 
condition described by the customer (at an temperature above 0 
ºC (32 ºF), longer when it is lower than 0 ºC (32 ºF) although 
the A/C Compressor Regulator Valve -N280- is not currently 
activated) or too high (above 10 ºC (50 ºF) even though the A/C 
is working correctly). Can ice up caused by the incorrect 
measured value from the evaporator. Use the Vehicle Diagnostic 
Tester ("OBD" or "Guided Fault Finding for the A/C system") and
→&nbsp;Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.87;&nbsp;System 
Overview - Refrigerant Circuit (vehicle-specific 
repair manual).</p>
<p>-&nbsp;In vehicles without the Evaporator Vent Temperature Sensor 
-G263-, for example via the Footwell Vent Temperature Sensor 
-G192-, check vent temperature at the adjustment: "Lo 
temperature" for driver and passenger side, 4 or 5 bar (58 or 73 
psi) for fresh air blower RPM, air outlet in footwell and fresh 
air operation under operating conditions specified by customer. 
If measured value of sensor is too low (at ambient temperature 
above 0 ºC (32 ºF), colder than 0 ºC (32 ºF) for a long period 
of time).</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Check refrigerant line from evaporator to accumulator (thick 
tube, low pressure side) with engine running. If this line is 
thickly iced-up when complaint occurs (a thin layer of ice is 
permitted), this also indicates that the temperature in the 
evaporator is too low.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Discharge refrigerant circuit, replace accumulator or 
receiver/dryer with dryer and evacuate refrigerant circuit for a 
minimum of three hours.</p>

<strong>Note</strong></p>
<p><em>On vehicles with high-voltage system and additional

check the pressures in the refrigerant circuit with the A/C 
system switched off no areas may be closed be closed, for this 
reason the valves must be opened before these procedures. Refer

<ul>
	<li><em>Temperature of refrigerant circuit components should be 
equal to ambient temperature. Pressure will deviate from values 
in table if individual components of refrigerant circuit are 
warmer or colder.</em></li>
	<li><em>At absolute pressure, 0 bar/psi corresponds to absolute 
vacuum. Normal ambient pressure (positive pressure) corresponds 
to 1 bar (14.5 psi) absolute pressure. 0 pressure corresponds to 
an absolute pressure of 1 bar (14.5 psi) on most pressure gauges 
(indicated by -1 bar (-14.5 psi) below 0).</em></li>
	<li><em>For vehicles with High Pressure Sensor -G65-, Refrigerant
