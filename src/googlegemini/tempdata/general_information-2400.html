						<p></p>
			<p><p>High pressure side are the condenser, receiver/dryer and 
restrictor or expansion valve to separate the high and low 
pressure liquid ends.</p>
<p>High pressure results from the restrictor or expansion valve 
forming a constriction and causing the refrigerant to 
accumulate, thus leading to an increase in pressure and 
temperature.</p>
<p>Excess pressure occurs if too much refrigerant or 
refrigerant oil is used, the condenser is contaminated, the 
radiator fan is malfunctioning, the system is blocked or there 
is moisture in the refrigerant circuit (icing-up of restrictor 
or expansion valve).</p>
<p>Low pressure side are the evaporator, reservoir, evaporator 
temperature sensor and A/C compressor to separate high and low 
pressure gas ends.</p>
<p>A drop in system pressure can be caused by loss of 
refrigerant, the restrictor or expansion valve (no 
constriction), a malfunctioning A/C compressor or an iced-up 
evaporator.</p>
<p><u><strong>Mechanically Driven A/C Compressor</strong></u></p>
<p>The A/C compressor is driven by a ribbed belt or a input 
shaft, which is driven by the vehicle engine.</p>
<p><strong>A/C Compressor with A/C Clutch</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>An electromagnetic clutch -A- 
attached to A/C compressor provides the power link between the 
ribbed belt pulley -B- and A/C 
compressor crankshaft with A/C system switched on.</li>
	<li>An overload safeguard attached to the clutch plate or in the 
A/C compressor solenoid coil is tripped if the compressor does 
not move freely, thus protecting the belt drive against 
overload.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A/C Compressor without A/C Clutch</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>An overload safeguard attached to the pulley of the 
compressor -B- is tripped if the 
compressor does not move freely, thus protecting the belt drive 
against overload.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All A/C Clutch</strong></p>
<p>The A/C compressor extracts the refrigerant gas from the 
evaporator, compresses it and relays it to the condenser.</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>The A/C compressor contains refrigerant oil, which can be 
mixed with refrigerant R134a under any temperature.</em></li>
	<li><em>The data plate lists the type of refrigerant required for 
the A/C compressor. A regulator valve regulates pressure within 
the specified range (control characteristics) on the low 
pressure side.</em></li>
	<li><em>A/C compressors with or without an A/C clutch are currently 
controlled externally by a regulator valve 
-C-.</em></li>
	<li><em>On A/C compressors without an A/C clutch, the engine is only 
to be started following complete assembly of the refrigerant 
circuit.</em></li>
	<li><em>So that the A/C compressor does not get damaged when the 
refrigerant circuit is empty, the A/C clutch is turned off and 
the A/C Compressor Regulator Valve -N280- is no longer activated 
(A/C compressor runs at idle with engine).</em></li>
	<li><em>If the refrigerant circuit is empty, a A/C compressor 
without A/C Clutch -N25- with (A/C Compressor Regulator Valve 
-N280-) is switched to internal lubrication by way of a valve.</em></li>
	<li><em>Depending on the A/C compressor version, there may be a 
valve installed on the high pressure side of the A/C compressor, 
which prevents the liquid refrigerant from flowing back into the 
compressor once the A/C is turned off. If an A/C compressor with 
this valve is installed in a vehicle with a refrigerant circuit 
having an expansion valve, then it may take some time until the 
pressure in the high pressure side decreases (the expansion is 
cold and the pressure in the low pressure side quickly increases 
after it is turned off, the expansion valve closes and the 
refrigerant flows slowly into the low pressure side). If the A/C 
compressor is switched on, the pressure on the low pressure side 
goes down, the expansion valve open and the refrigerant can flow 
of the low pressure side.</em></li>
	<li><em>The electromagnetic clutch -A- 
is activated only when the regulator valve 
-C- is activated on an A/C compressor with an 
electromagnetic clutch -A- and with 
a regulator valve -C-. Refer to
→&nbsp;Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.87;&nbsp;System 
Overview - Refrigerant Circuit.</em></li>

<p><u><strong>Electrically Driven A/C Compressor for Vehicles with High Voltage 
System</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Vehicles with a High-Voltage System (Hybrid Vehicles)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Extremely Dangerous Due to High-Voltage</strong></p>
<p>The high-voltage system is under high-voltage. Death or serious 
bodily injury by electric shock.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Individuals with electronic/medical life- and health sustaining 
machines in or on their person cannot perform any work on high-voltage 
systems. Life- and health sustaining machines are for example pain 
killer pumps, implanted defibrillators, pacemakers, insulin pumps, and 
hearing aids.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Have the high-voltage system de-energized by a qualified person.</p>
<p><strong>There is a Risk Of Injury from the Engine Starting Unexpectedly</strong></p>
<p>On electric - hybrid vehicles an active ready mode is difficult to 
identify. Parts of the body can be clamped or pulled.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Turn off the ignition.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Place the ignition key outside of the vehicle interior.</p>
<p><strong>Risk of Damaging the High-Voltage Cables</strong></p>
<p>Misuse can damage the insulation of high-voltage cables or 
high-voltage connectors.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Never support objects on the high-voltage cables and the 
high-voltage connectors.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Never support tools on the high-voltage cables and the high-voltage 
connectors.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Never sharply bend or kink the high-voltage cables.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;When connecting pay attention to the coding of the high-voltage 
connectors.</p>
<ul>
	<li>For all procedures on vehicles with high-voltage system pay 
attention to the additional warning message for these vehicles. 
Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Warnings when Working on Vehicles with High Voltage 
System".</li>
	<li>If procedures are necessary near components of the 
high-voltage system "perform a visual inspection of the damage 
of the high-voltage components and lines". Refer to
→&nbsp;Chapter "Performing a Visual Inspection of Damage to High 
Voltage Components and Cables".</li>
	<li>If work on the components of the high-voltage system is 
necessity, de-energize the high-voltage system. Refer to
→&nbsp;Rep. Gr.93;&nbsp;High-Voltage System, De-Energizing or
→&nbsp;Electrical Equipment;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.93;&nbsp;High-Voltage System, 
De-Energizing.</li>
</ul>
<p>-&nbsp;Charge the vehicle battery, for example, using the Battery 
Charger -VAS5904- in the battery support mode to minimize the 
number of automatic starts during the test- and measuring 
procedures while the ready mode is active. Refer to
→&nbsp;Electrical Equipment General Information;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.27;&nbsp;Battery, 
Charging and 
→&nbsp;High Voltage Vehicle General Information;&nbsp;Rep. 
Gr.93;&nbsp;High-Voltage System General Warnings.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;For testing and measurement procedures that require the 
ready mode to be active or the ignition to be switched on, the 
selector lever must be in the "P" position and the parking brake 
must be activated. The required tools must be placed so that 
they do not come into contact with any rotating components in 
the engine and they must also not go into the vicinity of the 
rotating components when the engine is running.</p>
<p><strong>Electrically-Driven A/C Compressor </strong> </p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/achtung.jpg"> 
&nbsp; <strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Risk of short circuit</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>The A/C compressor works with up to 288 volts at 800 
to 8,600 RPM.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Do not touch the A/C compressor when the ignition is 
turned on or when the drive machines are activated 
because of the short circuit risk.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
	<li>The A/C compressor extracts the refrigerant gas from the 
evaporator, compresses it and relays it to the condenser.</li>
	<li>The electric motor for the A/C compressor is powered with 
voltage from the Electric Drive Power and Control Electronics 
-JX1-.</li>
	<li>The A/C Compressor Control Module -J842- integrated in the 
A/C compressor controls the rotation and thereby the output for 
the A/C compressor (Electrical A/C Compressor -V470-) 
corresponding with the Data bus receiving requirements. Use the 
Vehicle Diagnostic Tester in the "Guided Fault Finding" Function 
for the A/C System and the Battery Regulation.</li>
	<li>There is no A/C Compressor Regulator Valve -N280- installed 
in the electrically-driven A/C compressor.</li>
	<li>Check the attachment points on the A/C compressor and the 
bracket prior to installation. The contact surfaces must be 
clean and free of rust and grease. Otherwise, repair the contact 
surfaces with the Contact Surface Cleaning Set -VAS6410-. Refer 
to 
→&nbsp;Electrical Equipment General Information;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.97;&nbsp;Wire and 
Connector Repair.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Check the amount of refrigerant oil in the new A/C 
compressor if the A/C Compressor Control Module -J842- is 
faulty. Do not flush the refrigerant circuit with R134a.</em></li>
	<li><em>The A/C Compressor Control Module -J842- and the Electrical 
A/C Compressor -V470- are one component and are currently not 
able to be separated.</em></li>
	<li><em>There is no A/C Compressor Regulator Valve -N280- installed 
in the electrically driven A/C compressor. The A/C compressor 
output is regulated externally by the A/C compressor speed. 
Refer to 
→&nbsp;Wiring diagrams, Troubleshooting &amp; Component locations 
and use the Vehicle Diagnostic Tester in the "Guided Fault 
Finding" Function for the A/C System and the Battery Regulation.</em></li>
	<li><em>The electrically-driven A/C compressor functions according 
to the principle of a spiral charger (similar to a G-charger).</em></li>
	<li><em>The A/C compressor contains refrigerant oil, which can be 
mixed with refrigerant R134a under any temperature.</em></li>
	<li><em>The data plate lists the type of refrigerant required for 
the A/C compressor. </em> </li>
	<li><em>The installed electronics are controlled by the speed of the 
A/C compressor power output (and the pressure on the low 
pressure side) within the specified range (control 
characteristic).</em></li>
	<li><em>The engine should only be started if the refrigerant circuit 
is completely assembled.</em></li>
	<li><em>The A/C compressor is equipped with a protected oil supply, 
this prevents A/C compressor damage in the event that the system 
is empty. This means that approximately&nbsp;40 to 50 cm<sup>3</sup> 
of refrigerant oil remains in the A/C compressor.</em></li>
	<li><em>The electrically-driven A/C compressor has a relief valve 
like the mechanically-driven A/C compressor.</em></li>
	<li><em>Hybrid drive on vehicles with battery cooling is only 
possible with a fully charged A/C system in which there are no 
stored errors. Use the Vehicle Diagnostic Tester in the "Guided 
Fault Finding" Function for the A/C System and the Battery 
Regulation.</em></li>
	<li><em>After the installation of the electrically-driven A/C 
compressor and the subsequent filling of the refrigerant 
circuit, start the A/C compressor for the first time using the 
"compressor intake" function for the basic setting. The A/C 
compressor may otherwise become damaged if before installation, 
refrigerant oil was improperly stored in the A/C compressor 
compression chamber. Use the Vehicle Diagnostic Tester in the 
"Guided Fault Finding" Function for the A/C System and the 
Battery Regulation.</em></li>
	<li><em>Only activate the electrically-driven A/C compressor when 
the refrigerant circuit is filled. The A/C compressor may become 
damaged if the A/C compressor is run when the refrigerant 
circuit is empty. Use the Vehicle Diagnostic Tester in the 
"Guided Fault Finding" Function for the A/C System and the 
Battery Regulation.</em></li>
