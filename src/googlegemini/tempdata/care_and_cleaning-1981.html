						<p></p>
			<p><p><strong>General information</strong></p>
<p>Regular, proper care helps to maintain your vehicle's
value. It can also be a requirement when
submitting warranty claims for corrosion damage
and paint defects on the body.</p>
<p>
The required cleaning and care products can be
obtained from an authorized Audi dealer or authorized
Service Facility. Read and follow the instructions
for use on the packaging.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong><u>Using cleaning and care products incorrectly
	can be dangerous to your health.</u></strong></li>
	<li><strong><u>Always store cleaning and care products out
	of reach of children to reduce the risk of poisoning.</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For the sake of the environment</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><u>Purchase environmentally-friendly cleaning
	products if possible.</u></li>
	<li><u>Do not dispose of cleaning and care products
	with household trash.</u></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Car washes</strong></p>
<p>The longer that deposits such as insects, bird
droppings, tree sap or road salt remain on the vehicle,
the more the surface can be damaged. High
temperatures such as those caused by sunlight
increase the damaging effect.</p>
<p>
Before washing, rinse off heavy deposits with
plenty of water.</p>
<p>
Stubborn deposits such as bird droppings or tree
sap are best removed with plenty of water and a
microfiber cloth.</p>
<p>
Also, wash the underside of your vehicle once
road salt stops being used for the season.</p>
<p><strong>Pressure washers</strong></p>
<p>When washing your vehicle with a pressure washer,
always follow the operating instructions provided
with the pressure washer. This is especially
important in regard to the pressure and spraying
distance. Do not aim the spray directly at the seals on the side windows, doors, 
lids or the sunroof*
or at tires, rubber hoses, insulating material,
sensors* or camera lenses*. Maintain a distance
of at least 16 inches (40 cm).</p>
<p>
Do not remove snow and ice with a pressure
washer.</p>
<p>
Never use cone nozzles or high pressure nozzles.</p>
<p>
The water temperature must not be above 140 ºF
(60 ºC).</p>
<p><strong>Automatic car wash</strong></p>
<p>Spray off the vehicle before washing.</p>
<p>
Make sure that the windows and roof* are closed
and the windshield wipers are off. Make sure that
the vehicle is still able to roll during the washing
process in the car wash. Follow instructions from
the car wash operator, especially if there are accessories
attached to your vehicle.</p>
<p>
If possible, use car washes that do not have
brushes.</p>
<p><strong>Washing by hand</strong></p>
<p>Clean the vehicle starting from the top and working
downward using a soft sponge or cleaning
brush. Use solvent-free cleaning products.</p>
<p><strong>Washing vehicles with matte finish paint by
hand</strong></p>
<p>To reduce the risk of damaging the paint when
washing, first remove dust and large particles
from your vehicle. Insects, grease spots, and fingerprints
are best removed with a special cleaner
for matte finish paint.</p>
<p>
Apply the product using a microfiber cloth. To reduce
the risk of damaging the paint surface, do
not use too much pressure.</p>
<p>
Rinse the vehicle thoroughly with water. Then
clean using a neutral shampoo and a soft microfiber
cloth.</p>
<p>
Rinse the vehicle thoroughly again and let it air
dry. Remove any water residue using a chamois.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><u><strong>To reduce the risk of accidents, only wash
	the vehicle when the ignition is off and follow the instructions from the 
	car wash
	operator.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>To reduce the risk of cuts, protect yourself
	from sharp metal components when washing
	the underbody or the inside of the wheel
	housings.</strong></u></li>
	<li><strong><u>After washing the vehicle, the braking effect
	may be delayed due to moisture on the
	brake rotors or ice in the winter. This increases
	the risk of an accident. The brakes
	must be dried with a few careful brake applications.</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>If you wash the vehicle in an automatic car wash, you must fold the 
	exterior mirrors in to reduce the risk of damage to the mirrors.</em><p><em>
	Power folding exterior mirrors* must only be folded in and out using the 
	power folding function.</em></p></li>
	<li><em>To reduce the risk of damage to the rims and tires, compare the width 
	between the wheels
	on your vehicle with the distance between the guide rails in the car wash.</em></li>
	<li><em>To reduce the risk of damage, compare the height and width of your 
	vehicle with the height and width of the inside of the car wash.</em></li>
	<li><em>To reduce the risk of paint damage, do not
	wash the vehicle in direct sunlight.</em></li>
	<li><em>To reduce the risk of damage, do not wash
	decorative decals* with a pressure washer.</em></li>
	<li><em>To reduce the risk of damage to the surface,
	do not use insect removing sponges, kitchen
	sponges, or similar items.</em></li>
	<li><em>When washing matte finish painted vehicle
	components:</em><ul>
		<li><em>To reduce the risk of damage to the surface,
		do not use polishing agents or hard
		wax.</em></li>
		<li><em>Never use protective wax. It can destroy
		the matte finish effect.</em></li>
		<li><em>Do not place any stickers or magnetic
		signs on vehicle components painted with
		matte finish paint. The paint could be damaged when the stickers or 
		magnets are removed.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For the sake of the environment</strong></p>
<p><u>Only wash the vehicle in facilities specially designed for that purpose. 
This will reduce the risk of dirty water contaminated with oil from entering the 
sewer system.</u></p>
<p><strong>Cleaning and care information</strong></p>
<p>When cleaning and caring for individual vehicle components, refer to the 
following tables. The information contained there is simply recommendations. For 
questions or for components that are not listed, consult an authorized Audi 
dealer or authorized Audi Service Facility. Also follow the information found in

<p><strong>WARNING </strong></p>
<p><u><strong>The windshield must not be treated with water-
repelling windshield coating agents. Under
unfavorable conditions, such as wetness,
darkness, and when the sun is low, these coatings
can cause increased glare, which increases
the risk of an accident. They can also cause
wiper blade chatter.</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>

		<li><em>Make sure that the display and instrument
		cluster are switched off and have cooled
		down before cleaning. To switch off the
		center display, select on the MMI home
		screen: SETTINGS &gt; Display &amp; brightness
		&gt; MMI &gt; Screen cleaning.</em></li>

	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>

	has been freshly waxed.</em></li>
	<li><em>Regular waxing can prevent rust spots from
	forming.</em></li>
	<li><em>Decorative decals can age due to environmental
	conditions, which can result in damage
	such as brittleness. The color may fade
	if exposed to excessive sunlight.</em></li>
</ul>
