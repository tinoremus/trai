	<li><em>Observe the test requirements. Refer to

	<li><em>If a malfunction occurs at only one evaporator in vehicles 
with two evaporators, also check pressures in the refrigerant

evaporator in question and the exit of line connection at 
distribution point of refrigerant lines (for constriction). If 
no malfunction can be detected, discharge the refrigerant 
circuit and charge it with the specified refrigerant quantity. 
Then check pressures and cooling performance of A/C system 
again; if the malfunction occurs again, replace the expansion 
valve which is prematurely switched by the malfunctioning 
evaporator. Refer to

	<li><em>If high cooling output is needed (for example, the outside 
temperature is very high, the blower speed it set on high but 
the engine RPMs are low), then the A/C compressor will not bring 
the pressure on the low pressure side to the value specified in 
the diagram -C- (for example, for a 
certain time after turning on the A/C). The A/C compressor is 
actuated with maximum specified control current, however 
delivery volume is no longer sufficient at this engine speed to 
reduce pressure on low-pressure side to value in graph. To check 
the A/C compressor control under these conditions, for example, 
the fresh air blower is controlled only with approximately 40% 
of the maximum voltage, check the pressures at a lower fresh air 
blower speed. Use the Vehicle Diagnostic Tester ("OBD" or 
"Guided Fault Finding for the A/C system") and
