<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Cleaning the refrigerant circuit means flushing with 
refrigerant R134a. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Refrigerant Circuit, Cleaning (Flushing), with 
Refrigerant R134a".</em></li>
	<li><em>If a faulty A/C compressor is replaced with an A/C 
compressor from another manufacturer check for the A/C 
compressor to be installed has the same refrigerant oil approved 
which is already in the refrigerant circuit (from the removed 
A/C compressor). If a different refrigerant oil is approved for 
the A/C compressor to be installed then the A/C compressor which 
was removed, the refrigerant circuit must be flushed. Refer to
→&nbsp;Chapter "Approved Refrigerant Oils".</em></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in the event of external damage following an 
accident (or for an electrical fault).</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Discharge the refrigerant circuit.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Remove the A/C compressor. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.87;&nbsp;A/C 
Compressor (vehicle-specific repair manual).</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<p><em>Use different refrigerant oils and quantities for the 
various compressors. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Refrigerant Oil Capacities".</em></p>
<p><strong>Electrically-Driven A/C compressor</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>When and electrically driven A/C compressor is replaced 
determine the amount of refrigerant oil found in the removed A/C 
compressor by flushing. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Electrically Driven A/C Compressor, Rinsing (Remove 
Refrigerant Oil)". Pour the refrigerant oil out of 
the A/C compressor to be installed so that only the amount or 
refrigerant oil remains in the A/C compressor as the amount 
flushed out of the removed A/C compressor. Refer to
→&nbsp;Chapter "Refrigerant Oil Capacities". </li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>From the A/C compressor to be replaced 120 cm<sup>3</sup> 
is flushed. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Electrically Driven A/C Compressor, Rinsing (Remove 
Refrigerant Oil)".</li>
	<li>In the A/C compressor to be installed there are 200 cm<sup>3</sup> 
refrigerant oil. Refer to the data plate and 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Refrigerant Oil Capacities".</li>
</ul>
<p>-&nbsp;Tip out from the new A/C compressor (next over the 
connection for the refrigerant pipe low pressure side) enough 
refrigerant that only the amount of refrigerant oil (plus 10 cm<sup>3</sup>) 
remains in it, as before the replaced A/C compressor was flushed 
out. An example is 110 cm<sup>3</sup> 
refrigerant oil (this will insure that the refrigerant oil 
quantity in the refrigerant circuit after installing is 
correct).</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Electrically driven A/C compressors cannot have the 
refrigerant oil poured out in the same manner as a mechanically 
driven A/C compressor. There is no drain plug, the A/C 
compression cannot be turned and because it is installed inside 
defending on the version only a specialized part or no 
refrigerant oil can be poured out. (Due to the different 
distribution of refrigerant oil in the A/C compressor). Usually 
a residual amount between 30 and 80 cm<sup>3</sup> 
remains in the A/C compressor when pouring out. For this reason, 
the removed A/C compressor is to be flushed to remove the 
refrigerant oil and to determine the amount of refrigerant oil, 
depending on the complaint. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Electrically Driven A/C Compressor, Rinsing (Remove 
Refrigerant Oil)".</em></li>
	<li><em>If the recommended amount of refrigerant oil cannot be 
poured out of the A/C compressor to be installed if necessary 
the new A/C compressor to be installed may be flushed. In the 
new A/C compressor as much refrigerant oil the amount is to be 
filled as was flushed out of the old A/C compressor. Refer to
→&nbsp;Chapter "Electrically Driven A/C Compressor, Rinsing (Remove 
Refrigerant Oil)".</em></li>
	<li><em>At room temperature the refrigerant oil had approximately 
the same density as water (1 kg equals a liter).</em></li>
	<li><em>Also electrical A/C compressors of the same version (same 
manufacturer, same part number) mostly do not have the same 
weight so that the amount of refrigerant oil contained cannot be 
determined by weighing (the tolerances are too large, to 
determine the amount of refrigerant oil contained via the 
weight).</em></li>
	<li><em>Depending on the construction and the storage of the A/C 
compressor the refrigerant oil separated unevenly in the A/C 
compressor. One part can be located in the compression chamber 
and another in the area of the electronic motor, so that here 
the refrigerant oil must be alternately poured out via both 
connections for the refrigerant lines (high and low pressure 
side). While doing this arrange the A/C compressor so that the 
relevant connection is as far downward as possible.</em></li>
	<li><em>Dispose of the refrigerant oil removed from the defective 
and the new A/C compressor and poured out refrigerant oil from 
the new A/C compressor which is no longer necessary. Pay 
attention to local regulations.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mechanically Driven A/C Compressor</strong></p>
<p>-&nbsp;Remove the drain plug from the A/C compressor (mechanically 
driven A/C compressor).</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<p><em>There are different versions of the oil drain plug and its 
seal (it can be either an O-ring or a gasket; always replace). 
Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Leaking or Damaged Components except A/C Compressor, 
Reservoir or Receiver/Dryer" and to the Parts 
Catalog.</em></p>
<p>-&nbsp;To accelerate drainage of refrigerant oil, rotate the A/C 
compressor by way of clutch plate of A/C clutch, for example.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Drain the old refrigerant oil from the A/C compressor and 
dispose. Pay attention to local regulations.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Remove the oil drain plug from replacement A/C compressor, 
pour out refrigerant oil in a clean container and only add a 
quantity of fresh refrigerant oil equal to the amount poured out 
of the malfunctioning A/C compressor.</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/Vorsicht.jpg"> 
&nbsp; <strong>Caution</strong></p>
<p><em>There is a risk of damaging the A/C compressor with 
dirty refrigerant oil.</em></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Refrigerant oil that is poured out from the new A/C 
compressor can only be reused when it is located in a 
clean container and the necessary amount after pour out 
is refilled in the A/C compressor.</em></li>
	<li><em>Do not reuse refrigerant oil when it is dirty or 
there is moisture, this is to be disposed of.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>If, for example, 70 cm<sup>3</sup> of 
refrigerant oil has been poured out of the defective A/C 
compressor and 220 cm <sup>3</sup> out of the 
replacement A/C compressor (a small quantity of refrigerant oil 
remains in the A/C compressor). In this case fill the A/C 
compressor that is to be installed with 70 cm
<sup>3</sup> refrigerant oil. The refrigerant 
oil that was poured out of the new (replacement) A/C compressor 
can be reused, if there is no dirt of moisture in it.</em></li>
	<li><em>Use different refrigerant oils and quantities for the 
various compressors. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Refrigerant R134a Capacities, Refrigerant Oil and 
Approved Refrigerant Oils".</em></li>
	<li><em>If a greater quantity of refrigerant oil (more than 
approximately 40 cm <sup>3</sup>) has been 
poured out of the malfunctioning compressor, the remaining 
refrigerant oil can also be added to the evaporator or 
receiver/dryer. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Refrigerant R134a Capacities, Refrigerant Oil and 
Approved Refrigerant Oils".</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All</strong></p>
<p>-&nbsp;Replace the restrictor (only if there is one in this 
refrigerant circuit).</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Assemble, evacuate and charge the refrigerant circuit.</p><ul></ul></table></ul><div style="clear:both"></div><div align="center"></div><h2 style="border-top:1px solid #222; padding-top:15px; margin-top: 15px;">READ NEXT:</h2>
