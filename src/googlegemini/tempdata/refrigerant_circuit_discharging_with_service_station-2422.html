<p>-&nbsp;Open the electrically activated valves, which to now open 
without power using the Vehicle Diagnostic Tester in the "Guided 
Fault Finding" function.</p>
<p><strong>All</strong></p>
<p>-&nbsp;Discharge the refrigerant circuit using the A/C service 
station according to the operating instructions.</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/Vorsicht.jpg"> 
&nbsp; <strong>Caution</strong></p>
<p><em>There is a risk of damaging the A/C compressor if 
the refrigerant circuit is empty.</em></p>
<p><em>Do not start the motor if the refrigerant circuit is 
empty.</em></p>

&nbsp; <strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>There is a danger of ice-up.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Refrigerant may leak out if refrigerant circuit is 
not discharged.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Refrigerant must be extracted before opening 
refrigerant circuit. If refrigerant circuit is not 
opened within 10 minutes of extraction, pressure may 
form in refrigerant circuit due to evaporation. Extract 
the refrigerant once more.</strong></em></p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>There is a possibility of refrigerant oil being extracted 
from the refrigerant circuit together with the refrigerant. To 
ensure compressor lubrication, the refrigerant oil in the 
circuit must be topped up with fresh oil. Refer to
→&nbsp;Chapter "Refrigerant R134a Capacities, Refrigerant Oil and 
Approved Refrigerant Oils".</em></li>
	<li><em>On vehicles fitted with a compressor with no A/C clutch 
(with A/C Compressor Regulator Valve -N280-) the engine should 
not be run for longer than absolutely necessary with the 
refrigerant circuit empty (A/C compressor always in operation as 
well).</em></li>
	<li><em>On vehicles with a compressor with no A/C clutch, the engine 
is only to be started following complete assembly of the 
refrigerant circuit (avoid high engine speeds).</em></li>
	<li><em>Depending on the A/C compressor version, there may be a 
valve installed on the high pressure side of the A/C compressor, 
which prevents the liquid refrigerant from flowing back into the 
compressor once the A/C is turned off. If an A/C compressor with 
this valve is installed in a vehicle with a refrigerant circuit 
having an expansion valve, then it may take some time until the 
pressure in the high pressure side decreases (the expansion is 
cold and the pressure in the low pressure side quickly increases 
after it is turned off, the expansion valve closes and the 
refrigerant flows slowly into the low pressure side). If the A/C 
compressor is switched on (or the refrigerant circuit is 
evacuated on the low pressure side) the pressure on the low 
pressure side goes down, the expansion valve open and the 
refrigerant can flow of the low pressure side.</em></li>
	<li><em>Depending on the version of the A/C service station, the 
previous operating conditions and the ambient temperatures, 
etc., the amount displayed by the A/C service station for the 
evacuated refrigerant R134a can vary from the actual evacuated 
amount. The amount displayed by the A/C service station for the 
evacuated refrigerant is therefore only a reference point of the 
amount of refrigerant actually evacuated from the refrigerant 
circuit. Also pay attention to the A/C service station operating 
instructions and technical product description.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Should work be performed on the vehicle after discharging 
which does not require using the A/C service station</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Disconnect the A/C service station from the refrigerant 
circuit and turn it off.</p>
<p>Should the refrigerant circuit after the discharge be 
evacuated and refilled. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Refrigerant Circuit, Charging with Service Station".</p>
<p><strong>Refrigerant Circuit, Discharging with Service Station</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The work procedure is always to be performed as described in 
the operating instructions for the A/C service station.</li>
	<li>The quantity of refrigerant oil in the circuit is checked 
and if necessary corrected. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Refrigerant R134a Capacities, Refrigerant Oil and 
Approved Refrigerant Oils".</li>
	<li>The quantity of refrigerant in the service station is 
checked.</li>
</ul>
<p>The refrigerant circuit must be evacuated before it is 
filled with refrigerant (vacuum). Moisture is also extracted 
from the circuit.</p>
<p>Leaks may be found when evacuating the refrigerant circuit.</p>
<p>Evacuating:</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/Vorsicht.jpg"> 
&nbsp; <strong>Caution</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Do not start the engine during the evacuation 
process or when there is a vacuum in the refrigerant 
circuit.</em></li>
	<li><em>The A/C compressor could be damaged if the engine is 
started when there is a vacuum in the refrigerant 
circuit.</em></li>
	<li><em>Only start the engine when the refrigerant circuit 
is filled.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>-&nbsp;Turn off the ignition.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Connect the service station to the power supply.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Connect charging hose of service station to vehicles 
refrigerant circuit with quick-release coupling adapter. Refer 
to vehicle-specific refrigerant circuit. Refer to
→&nbsp;Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.87;&nbsp;System 
Overview - Refrigerant Circuit (vehicle-specific 
repair manual).</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Only tighten the handwheel on the quick-release coupling 
adapter just enough so the valves in the service connections are 
securely open. Do not put too much pressure on the valve.</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>If pressure is to be measured after charging system on 
vehicles with a service connection on one side of the 
refrigerant circuit only, use valve adapter and charging hose 
with valve opener. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "A/C Service Station, Connecting".</p>
<p>Additionally on vehicles with an electric operated valves in 
the refrigerant circuit, which cannot be opened without power 
(for example the Audi Q7 e-tron):</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>On vehicles with high-voltage system and additional 
functions of the A/C system ("heat pump operation" or "cooling 
the high-voltage battery") valves may be installed in the 
refrigerant circuit which cannot be opened without power. These 
valves are opened and closed for example via a step motor and

→&nbsp;Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning;&nbsp;Rep. 
Gr.87;&nbsp;Refrigerant Circuit; System Overview - Refrigerant 
Circuit and use the Vehicle Diagnostic Tester in the 
"Guided Fault Finding" function.</li>
	<li>The check valves in the refrigerant circuit in the flow 
direction have a specified residual pressure (approximately 0.1 
bar or 100 mbar). So that the refrigerant circuit can be 
completely evacuates (residual pressure less than 5 mbar) all 
electrically activated valves must be opened.</li>
</ul>
<p>-&nbsp;Open the electrically activated valves, which to now open 
without power using the Vehicle Diagnostic Tester in the "Guided 
Fault Finding" function.</p>
<p><strong>All</strong></p>
<p>-&nbsp;Turn on the service station and evacuate the refrigerant 
circuit for at least 30 minutes. The pressure reading must 
indicate an absolute pressure of less than 10 bar (145 psi) 
(corresponding to 990 mbar (14.36 psi) vacuum).</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>At this pressure, both green Light Emitting Diodes (LED) 
light up, for example, on the current service station. Refer to 
the Parts Catalog (Tools; Special Tools and Equipment: A/C and 
Heating).</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Turn off the service station and allow it to stand for at 
least one hour.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the vacuum display (LED chain) does not change, the 
system is free of leaks and can be charged.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>A current vacuum reading (LED) is only obtained using the 
current service station, for example (for currently available 
service stations. Refer to the Parts Catalog (Tools; Special 
Tools and Equipment: A/C and Heating) after pressing the
Evacuate button again.</li>
	<li>If with this service station the upper (green) LEDs do not 
light immediately after turning on, either the refrigerant 
circuit is leaking or there is still residual 
moisture/refrigerant in the circuit.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img alt="N87-0528" src="images/books/2001/N87-0528.png"></p>
<p>If the vacuum is not maintained or cannot generate a 
sufficient vacuum, perform the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the pressure in refrigerant circuit increases slowly 
after evacuating, for example, through evaporation:</li>
</ul>
<p>-&nbsp;If it is possible that the refrigerant circuit may have 
leaks, evacuate and check the vacuum display again over several 
hours Only when the vacuum is maintained can the refrigerant 
circuit be charged.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;If the refrigerant circuit is sealed, it can be filled.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If there is a leak that allowed enough air to enter during 
evacuation that the A/C service station cannot generate a 
sufficient vacuum or that the vacuum is lost immediately after 
switching the A/C service station off:</li>
</ul>
<p>-&nbsp;Determine the location of the leak in the refrigerant 
circuit as follows:</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>A large leak can be identified if a maximum of pressure of 
15 bar (217 psi) can be generated in the refrigerant circuit 
using clean, dry compressed air or nitrogen. Refer to
→&nbsp;Chapter "Refrigerant Circuit, Flushing with Compressed Air and 
Nitrogen". If the leak is large enough, the sound of 
escaping air or gas can be heard at the location of the leak.</em></li>
	<li><em>Add the compressed air or nitrogen to the closed refrigerant 
circuit through the service connection after fitting it with a 
quick-release connector adapter.</em></li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img alt="V87-1468" src="images/books/2001/V87-1468.png"></p>
<ul>
	<li>The quick-release coupling adapter for service connections 
can be connected to the air compressor using a modified filler 
hose -A- (for example, with 5/8" 18 
UNF threads, different from the threads on the quick-release 
coupling adapter) and a suitable adapter 
-B-. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Improvised Tools". This keeps humidity, 
oil and dirt coming out of the workshop compressed air system 
from getting into the A/C refrigerant circuit. Also use a 
combination fine-gauge filter for compressed air systems such as 
those that are standard in paint shops. Install it between the 
compressed air system and the filler hose 
-A-. Refer to the Parts Catalog (Tools; Special Tools and 
Equipment: A/C and Heating)</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img alt="V87-1469" src="images/books/2001/V87-1469.png"></p>
<ul>
	<li>A compressed gas cylinder filled with nitrogen
-3- can be connected to the closed 
refrigerant circuit using a pressure gauge battery with a 
pressure reducer for nitrogen (maximum reduction pressure: 15 
bar (217 psi) ) -1- and a filler 
hose -2- (for example, with 5/8" 18 
UNF threads) connected to the service connection. A 
quick-release coupling adapter must also be connected to the 
service connection. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Commercially Available Tools and Materials".</li>
</ul>
<p>-&nbsp;Slowly increase the pressure in the refrigerant circuit to a 
maximum of 15 bar (217 psi).</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/achtung.jpg"> 
&nbsp; <strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em><strong>Nitrogen can leak uncontrolled from the cylinder.</strong></em></li>
	<li><em><strong>Make exclusive use of pressure reducers for nitrogen 
cylinders (maximum work pressure 15 bar (217 psi) ).</strong></em></li>
	<li><em><strong>When testing for leaks with nitrogen (maximum 
permissible pressure 15 bar (217 psi) ), always work with 
a pressure reducer for nitrogen bottles.</strong></em></li>
	<li><em><strong>Use appropriate extraction units to draw off gas 
mixture escaping from components.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>-&nbsp;Find the location of the leak by listening for the sound of 
venting gas.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Repair the leak.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Evacuate and again observe the vacuum display over a period 
of hours. Only when the vacuum is maintained can the refrigerant 
circuit be charged.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If there is a leak that is small enough that no air or very 
little air vents through it and the A/C service station can 
generate a sufficient vacuum: The vacuum indicator does not 
increase after switching the A/C system service station or only 
increases slowly, indicating that air is only entering through a 
small leak.</li>
</ul>
<p>-&nbsp;Add 100 grams of refrigerant to the circuit, find the 
location of the leak using an electronic leak detector and 
repair it. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Refrigerant Circuit, Tracing Leaks Using Electronic 
Leak Detector") or add UV contrast dye to the 
refrigerant and find the location of the leak with the Leak 
Detection Kit -VAS6201A-and repair it. Refer to
→&nbsp;Chapter "Leak Detection on Refrigerant Circuit Using Leak 
Detection Kit -VAS6201A-".</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Empty the refrigerant circuit, if necessary. Refer to
→&nbsp;Chapter "Refrigerant Circuit, Discharging with Service 
Station".</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Evacuate and check the vacuum display again over several 
hours. Only when the vacuum is maintained can the refrigerant 
circuit be charged.</p>
