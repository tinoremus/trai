			<p><p><strong>Vehicles with a High Voltage System (Hybrid Vehicles)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Extremely Dangerous Due to High-Voltage</strong></p>
<p>The high-voltage system is under high-voltage. Death or serious 
bodily injury by electric shock.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Individuals with electronic/medical life- and health sustaining 
machines in or on their person cannot perform any work on high-voltage 
systems. Life- and health sustaining machines are for example pain 
killer pumps, implanted defibrillators, pacemakers, insulin pumps, and 
hearing aids.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Have the high-voltage system de-energized by a qualified person.</p>
<p><strong>There is a Risk Of Injury from the Engine Starting Unexpectedly</strong></p>
<p>On electric - hybrid vehicles an active ready mode is difficult to 
identify. Parts of the body can be clamped or pulled.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Turn off the ignition.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Place the ignition key outside of the vehicle interior.</p>
<p><strong>Risk of Damaging the High-Voltage Cables</strong></p>
<p>Misuse can damage the insulation of high-voltage cables or 
high-voltage connectors.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Never support objects on the high-voltage cables and the 
high-voltage connectors.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Never support tools on the high-voltage cables and the high-voltage 
connectors.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Never sharply bend or kink the high-voltage cables.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;When connecting pay attention to the coding of the high-voltage 
connectors.</p>
<ul>
	<li>For all procedures on vehicles with high-voltage system pay 
attention to the additional warning message for these vehicles. 
Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Warnings when Working on Vehicles with High Voltage 
System".</li>
	<li>If procedures are necessary near components of the 
high-voltage system "perform a visual inspection of the damage 
of the high-voltage components and lines". Refer to
→&nbsp;Chapter "Performing a Visual Inspection of Damage to High 
Voltage Components and Cables".</li>
	<li>If work on the components of the high-voltage system is 
necessity, de-energize the high-voltage system. Refer to
→&nbsp;Rep. Gr.93;&nbsp;High-Voltage System, De-Energizing or
→&nbsp;Electrical Equipment;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.93;&nbsp;High-Voltage System, 
De-Energizing.</li>
</ul>
<p>-&nbsp;Charge the vehicle battery, for example, using the Battery 
Charger -VAS5904- in the battery support mode to minimize the 
number of automatic starts during the test- and measuring 
procedures while the ready mode is active. Refer to
→&nbsp;Electrical Equipment General Information;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.27;&nbsp;Battery; 
Charging the Battery and 
→&nbsp;Electrical Equipment;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.93;&nbsp;General Notes for Working on 
the High Voltage System.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Move the selector level into position "P", activate the 
parking brake and arrange the necessary tools for testing and 
measuring procedures that require the ready mode to be active or 
that require the ignition to be on, so that they cannot come 
into contact with the turning components in the engine and so 
that they are not in the vicinity of the turning components of a 
running engine.</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Also move the selector lever into position "P" and activate 
the parking brake for testing and measuring procedures which 
require the ignition to be on, but do not require the ready mode 
to be active.</em></li>
	<li><em>The ready mode is displayed in the Instrument Cluster 
Control Module -J285- above the "powermeter". Refer to Owner's 
Manual.</em></li>
	<li><em>Activate and deactivate the ready mode. Refer to Owner's 
Manual (consult the display in the Instrument Cluster Control 
Module -J285-).</em></li>
</ul>
<p>General notes to remove the refrigerant oil from the 
electrically driven A/C compressor (by flushing).</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Electrically driven A/C compressors cannot have the 
refrigerant oil poured out in the same manner as a mechanically 
driven A/C compressor. There is no drain plug and because it is 
installed inside defending on the version only a specialized 
part or no refrigerant oil can be poured out. Depending on the 
version and the storage of the A/C compressor there remains when 
pouring our approximately 30 to 80 cm <sup>3</sup> 
refrigerant oil in the A/C compressor (the electrically driven 
A/C compressor cannot be turned). For this reason, the A/C 
compressor is to be flushed to remove the refrigerant oil and to 
determine the amount of refrigerant oil in the A/C compressor, 
depending on the complaint. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Compressor, Replacing without the Need for Flushing 
Refrigerant Circuit".</em></li>
	<li><em>The refrigerant oil can be removed by flushing in the flow 
direction for electrically driven A/C compressors (because of 
the installed valve it is not possible to flush against the flow 
direction).</em></li>
	<li><em>To flush, arrange the A/C compressor so that the connection 
for the refrigerant line on the high pressure side is as low as 
possible.</em></li>
	<li><em>The electrically driven A/C compressor is to be flushed 
when, there is dirt, too much refrigerant oil is in the 
refrigerant circuit, or is contaminated (with moisture debris) 
and to remove refrigerant oil from the A/C compressor. In these 
cases the refrigerant circuit must also be flushed, so that it 
will be cleaned and the correct refrigerant oil quantity for the 
refrigerant circuit can be set. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Refrigerant Oil Capacities".</em></li>
	<li><em>If the electrically driven A/C compressor is replaced, it is 
not always necessary to flush the coolant circuit. The amount of 
refrigerant oil found in the removed A/C compressor can be 
removed by flushing the A/C compressor. Pour the refrigerant oil 
out of the new A/C compressor so that only the amount remains 
(plus 10 cm <sup>3</sup>) as before the old A/C 
compressor was flushed out. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Compressor, Replacing without the Need for Flushing 
Refrigerant Circuit".</em></li>
	<li><em>To remove the refrigerant oil from the removed A/C 
compressor the refrigerant oil must be flushed from the replaced 
A/C compressors and the removed about measured (Empty the used 
oil collection from the A/C service station before flushing). 
Pour the refrigerant oil out of the new A/C compressor so that 
only the amount or refrigerant oil remains (plus 10 cm
<sup>3</sup>) in the new A/C compressor as the 
amount of flushed out refrigerant oil from the old A/C 
compressor. Dispose of the refrigerant oil removed from the 
defective and the new A/C compressor and poured out refrigerant 
oil from the new A/C compressor. </em> </li>
	<li><em>In not enough refrigerant oil can be poured out from the A/C 
compressor to be installed, flush the new A/C compressor. Fill 
the A/C compressor to be installed in after flushing with as 
much new refrigerant oil as was flushed from the removed A/C 
compressor. Example: from the removed A/C compressor 120 cm
<sup>3</sup> refrigerant oil removed in the new 
A/C compressor to be installed there are 200 cm
<sup>3</sup>. Refer to the data plate and
→&nbsp;Chapter "Refrigerant Oil Capacities". Then from the 
A/C compressor to be installed 110 cm <sup>3</sup> 
(120 cm <sup>3</sup> minus 10 cm
<sup>3</sup>) must be poured out so that the 
refrigerant oil quantity in the refrigerant circuit after 
installing is correct. If the required amount of refrigerant oil 
cannot be poured out, flush the A/C compressor to be installed. 
In the new A/C compressor as much refrigerant oil is to be 
filled as was flushed out of the old A/C compressor.</em></li>
