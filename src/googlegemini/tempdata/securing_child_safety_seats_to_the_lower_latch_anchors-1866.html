<p>Observe the safety precautions.</p>
<p>
In the United States and Canada, child safety
seats can be secured without safety belts using
the LATCH system. LATCH stands for Lower Anchors
and Tethers for Children. In Canada, similar
systems are called UCRA, LUAS, or UAS.</p>
<p>
The lower LATCH anchors in your vehicle are located
on the outer seats of the rear bench seat
between the seat surface and the backrest. These
seating locations each have two lower LATCH anchors
that can be used to secure a LATCH child
safety seat. Marking points with a &gt; fig. 77 symbol
are located on the covers for the lower LATCH
anchors. You can locate the LATCH anchors using
the marking points.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Activate the child safety lock.<p>
	Remove the cover* from both lower LATCH anchors.</p></li>
	<li>If you secure a child safety seat to the rear seat,
	secure any unused safety belts that are within
	reach of the child.</li>
	<li>Secure the child safety seat according to the
	child safety seat manufacturer instructions.</li>
	<li>Pull on the child safety seat to check if both
	sides are engaged correctly in the LATCH anchors.</li>
	<li>If possible, also secure the child safety seat to
	the respective top tether anchor in the vehicle.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>The LATCH anchors in the vehicle are only designed
for child safety seats with the LATCH
system. To reduce the risk of serious or fatal
injury, never secure other child restraint systems, belts, or objects to the 
anchors.</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
<p><em>The LATCH anchors are designed for a total
weight (child and child safety seat combined)
up to 65 lbs (29 kg). If the total weight is
greater than this, the child safety seat must
be secured with the vehicle safety belt.</em></p>
<p><u><strong>Securing child safety seats with a safety belt</strong></u></p>
<p>Observe the safety precautions. The
front passenger's seat is a dangerous location for
a child, even with an advanced airbag system. If
exceptional circumstances require the child safety
seat to be placed on the front passenger's
seat, then the front passenger's airbag must be
deactivated. </p>
<p><strong>Securing child safety seats</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Activate the child safety lock.</li>
	<li>If you secure a child safety seat to the rear seat,
	secure any unused safety belts that are within
	reach of the child.</li>
	<li>If you secure a child safety seat to the front
	passenger's seat, adjust the front passenger's
	seat to the highest position.</li>
	<li>Secure the child safety seat according to the
	child safety seat manufacturer instructions.</li>
	<li>If necessary, activate the belt retractor lock.</li>
	<li>If the child safety seat is secured on the front
	passenger's seat, adjust the front passenger's
	seat backrest until it rests flat against the child
	safety seat. Also make sure that the upper safety
	belt fixture is behind the child safety seat.</li>
	<li>If you secure a child safety seat on the rear
	seat, also secure it to the correct top tether anchor
	if possible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Activating the belt retractor lock</strong></p>
<p>If you secure a child safety seat using the vehicle
safety belt, you must activate the belt retractor
lock. Follow the child safety seat manufacturer
instructions.</p>
<p>
The belt retractor lock prevents the safety belt
from becoming loose while driving, which could
result in the child safety seat no longer being adequately
secured.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Secure the child safety seat according to the
	child safety seat manufacturer instructions.<p>
	While doing so, pull out the safety belt. Insert
	the safety belt into the belt latch that belongs
	to that seat until it audibly locks.</p></li>
	<li>Pull the upper belt out completely and then allow
	it to retract. You will hear a clicking sound
	while the belt is retracting. It will not be possible
	to pull the safety belt out any farther.</li>
	<li>Push the child safety seat into the seat and allow
	the belt to retract more.</li>
	<li>Make sure that the child safety seat cannot
	move more than 1 inch (2.5 cm).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deactivating the belt retractor lock</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Unbuckle the safety belt from the belt latch.</li>
	<li>Remove the child safety seat according to the
	manufacturer instructions.</li>
	<li>Allow the safety belt to retract completely. The
	belt retractor lock is deactivated.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><u><strong>A safety belt that is not locked by the belt
	retractor lock or a locking device cannot secure
	a child safety seat while driving or in
	the event of an accident, which increases the risk of fatal injury. Always 
	make sure the belt retractor lock on the safety belt is activated
	if the child safety seat manufacturer
	instructions require it.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Due to the risk of fatal injury, never place a
	rear-facing child safety seat on the front
	passenger's seat when the front passenger's
	airbag is switched on.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>For the child safety seat to offer the maximum
	protection, it is especially important
	to route the vehicle safety belt correctly. Always
	follow the instructions from the child
	safety seat manufacturer for routing the
	safety belt correctly. Incorrectly fastened
	safety belts can cause injuries, even during
	minor accidents.</strong></u></li>
</ul>
<p><u><strong>Additionally securing a child safety seat to the top tether anchors</strong></u></p>

<strong>Fig. 73 Version (1) rear shelf/ Version (2) rear backrest: securing

<p>Observe the safety precautions.</p>
<p>There is a top tether anchor behind every seat in
the rear bench seat to additionally secure a child
safety seat with an upper belt.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Move the head restraint behind the child safety
	seat upward.</li>
	<li>Applies to: version 1: Fold the cover for the top
	tether anchor upward.</li>
	<li>Guide the upper belt on the child safety seat
	under the head restraint or along both sides of
	it and toward the rear (depending on the child
	safety seat model).</li>
	<li>Fasten the belt to the top tether anchor
	=&gt; fig. 73. While doing this, make sure the belt
	is not twisted and is not running over any sharp
	edges.</li>
	<li>Secure the child safety seat according to the
	child safety seat manufacturer instructions.</li>
	<li>Pull the belt tightly so that the child safety seat
	rests at the top of the seat backrest.</li>
	<li>If necessary, move the head restraint behind
	the child safety seat downward.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p><strong>The top tether anchors in the vehicle are only
designed for child safety seats equipped with
an upper strap. To reduce the risk of serious or
fatal injury, never secure other child restraint
systems, belts, or objects to the anchors.</strong></p>
<p><u><strong>Securing unused safety belts on the rear bench seat</strong></u></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/books/1816/index.70(3).png" alt="Sitting correctly and safely"><br>
<strong>Fig. 74 Rear bench seat: securing unused safety belts</strong></p>
<p>If a child safety seat is used on the rear bench
seat, the child must not be able to reach any
safety belts that are not being used. Secure safety
belts that are within reach of the child.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you secure a child safety seat to the LATCH
	anchors, fasten the safety belt on the seat
	where the child safety seat is installed using
	the seat's safety belt latch.</li>
	<li>If you secure a child safety seat to one of the
	outer seats, fasten the safety belt for the center
	seat in its latch.</li>
	<li>Activate the belt retractor lock on the fastened
	safety belts. To do this, pull the upper belt out
	completely and then allow it to retract. You will
	hear a clicking sound while the belt is retracting.</li>
	<li>It will not be possible to pull the safety
	belt out any farther.</li>
	<li>Make sure the fastened safety belt does not
	block access to the LATCH anchors. Otherwise,
	it may not be possible to secure the child safety
	seat to the LATCH anchors correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p><u><strong>A child in a child safety seat could play with
the unused safety belts and then become entangled
in them, which increases the risk of fatal injury. Always secure unused safety 
belts
so that they are not within reach of children in
child safety seats.</strong></u></p><ul></ul></table></ul><div style="clear:both"></div><div align="center"></div><h2 style="border-top:1px solid #222; padding-top:15px; margin-top: 15px;">READ NEXT:</h2>
