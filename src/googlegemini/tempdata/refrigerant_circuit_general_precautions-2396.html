→&nbsp;Rep. Gr.00;&nbsp;Safety Precautions or
→&nbsp;Electrical Equipment;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.93;&nbsp;General Warnings for Working 
on High-Voltage System.</li>
	<li>If procedures on components of the high-voltage system are 
required, de-energize the high-voltage system. Refer to
→&nbsp;Rep. Gr.00;&nbsp;Safety Precautions or
→&nbsp;Electrical Equipment;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.93;&nbsp;High Voltage System General 
Warnings.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The engine may only be started if the refrigerant circuit is 
completely assembled.</li>
	<li>Hybrid drive on vehicles with battery cooling is only 
possible with a full A/C system in which there are no stored 
errors. Use the Vehicle Diagnostic Tester in the "Guided Fault 
Finding" function for the A/C system and the battery regulation.</li>
	<li>After the installation of the electrically-driven A/C 
compressor and the subsequent filling of the refrigerant 
circuit, start the A/C compressor for the first time using the 
"compressor intake" function for the basic setting. If the 
refrigerant oil was improperly stored before installation in the 
A/C compressor compression chamber, the A/C compressor may 
become damaged. Use the Vehicle Diagnostic Tester in the "Guided 
Fault Finding" function for the A/C system and the battery 
regulation.</li>
	<li>Only activate the electrically-driven A/C compressor when 
the refrigerant circuit is filled. The A/C compressor may become 
damaged if the A/C compressor is run when the refrigerant 
circuit is empty. Use the Vehicle Diagnostic Tester in the 
"Guided Fault Finding" function for the A/C system and the 
battery regulation.</li>
	<li>So that the refrigerant circuit can be emptied, evacuated 
and filled depending on the design of the refrigerant circuit 
different electric controlled valves must be opened (for example 
on the Audi Q7 e-tron). Refer to 
→&nbsp;Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning;&nbsp;Rep. 
Gr.87;&nbsp;Refrigerant Circuit. Use the Vehicle 
Diagnostic Tester in the "Guided Fault Finding" function.</li>
	<li>For checking the A/C function specific electric controlled 
valves must be opened or closed (for example on the Audi Q7 
e-tron). Refer to 
→&nbsp;Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning;&nbsp;Rep. 
Gr.87;&nbsp;Refrigerant Circuit. Use the Vehicle 
Diagnostic Tester in the "Guided Fault Finding" function.</li>
	<li>The service connection on the high pressure side depends on 
the vehicle, not all operating conditions of the A/C system are 
on high pressure (for example on the Audi Q7 e-tron). For this 
reason to check the A/C function in these vehicles the sensor 
installed in the refrigerant circuit must be used. Refer to
→&nbsp;Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning;&nbsp;Rep. 
Gr.87;&nbsp;Refrigerant Circuit. Use the Vehicle 
Diagnostic Tester in the "Guided Fault Finding" function.</li>
</ul>
<p>-&nbsp;Charge the vehicle battery, for example, using the Battery 
Charger -VAS5904- in the battery support mode to minimize the 
number of automatic starts during the test- and measuring 
procedures while the ready mode is active. Refer to
→&nbsp;Electrical Equipment General Information;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.27;&nbsp;Battery, 
Charging and 
→&nbsp;High Voltage Vehicle General Information;&nbsp;Rep. 
Gr.93;&nbsp;High-Voltage System General Warnings.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;For testing and measurement procedures that require the 
ready mode to be active or the ignition to be switched on, the 
selector lever must be in the "P" position and the parking brake 
must be activated. The required tools must be placed so that 
they do not come into contact with any rotating components in 
the engine and they must also not go into the vicinity of the 
rotating components when the engine is running.</p>
<p><strong>O-Ring Seals</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Make exclusive use of seals which are resistant to 
refrigerant R134a and the related refrigerant oils. Color coding 
of O-rings is no longer employed. Colored and black O-rings are 
used.</li>
	<li>Be sure to use seals with the correct inner diameter. Refer 
to the Parts Catalog and 
→&nbsp;Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.87;&nbsp;System 
Overview - Refrigerant Circuit (vehicle-specific 
repair manual).</li>
	<li>The O-rings may be used only one time.</li>
	<li>Coat the seals lightly with refrigerant oil (PAG oil) before 
installing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>After Charging A/C System</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mechanically Driven A/C Compressor</strong></p>
<p>After installing the A/C Compressor to the engine (before 
positioning the belt or installing the driveshaft) Refer to
→&nbsp;Chapter "A/C System, Operating after Charging" and
→&nbsp;Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.87;&nbsp;A/C 
Compressor.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Turn the A/C compressor by hand via the clutch plate or belt 
pulley on the A/C clutch approximately 10 turns.</p>
<p>After charging. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "A/C System, Operating after Charging".</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Start the engine with the A/C turned off (A/C Clutch -N25- 
and A/C Compressor Regulator Valve -N280- are not actuated).</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Following engine idling speed stabilization, switch on A/C 
compressor and run it for at least 10 minutes at idling speed 
with maximum cooling output.</p>
<p><strong>Electrically Driven A/C Compressor</strong></p>
<p>-&nbsp;First start the electrically driven A/C compressor after 
filling the refrigerant circuit via the "Compressor Cut-In" 
function from the basic setting. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "A/C System, Operating after Charging" and 
Vehicle Diagnostic Tester in the "Guided Fault Finding" Function 
for the A/C System and the Battery Regulation.</p><ul></ul></table></ul><div style="clear:both"></div><div align="center"></div><h2 style="border-top:1px solid #222; padding-top:15px; margin-top: 15px;">READ NEXT:</h2>
