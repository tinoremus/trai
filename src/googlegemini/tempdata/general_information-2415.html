<strong>Note</strong></p>
<p><em>The laws and regulations listed below are applicable in 
Germany. Different or additional laws and regulations may apply 
in other countries.</em></p>
<p>The effects of climate change can be seen worldwide. 
Protecting the climate is one of the most important 
responsibilities. However, this responsibility presents enormous 
challenges to all involved.</p>
<p>The Kyoto Protocol outlines worldwide goals regarding 
climate protection, among other things. In addition to target 
reductions of carbon dioxide, this protocol also outlines target 
reductions for fluorinated greenhouse gases such as refrigerant 
R134a due to their high potential of contributing to the 
greenhouse effect.</p>
<p>Numerous laws have been created for the automotive industry, 
for example at the European level. For example, chemical-climate 
protection regulations were put into effect on August 1, 2008 in 
Germany in order to define the European legislation in more 
detail.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Provision (EU) number 1005/2009</li>
	<li>Provision (EU) number 2037/2000</li>
	<li>Provision (EU) number 842/2006 (from 01/01/2015: EU no. 
517/2014)</li>
	<li>Provision (EU) number 706/2007</li>
	<li>Provision (EU) number 307/2008</li>
	<li>Guideline 2006/40/EU</li>
	<li>Chemical-climate protection provision, recycling management 
and disposal regulations (for Germany).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Maintenance and Repair Work on the A/C System Refrigerant 
Circuit</strong></p>
<p>All individuals performing maintenance and repair work on 
vehicle A/C systems must have completed a training program and 
be competent in the work required. Other regulations may apply 
in addition to those of the European Union.</p>
<p>The Following General Points Apply:</p>
<p><strong>Operation, repair, decommissioning, take-back obligation</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>When operating, repairing and decommissioning items that 
contain refrigerant, allowing the refrigerant to vent into the 
air is prohibited.</li>
	<li>Keep records on the quantities used during operation and 
maintenance so they can be presented to the authorities upon 
request. A record sheet no longer needs to be kept in the EU due 
to a provision by the European Parliament in 2005. Other 
provisions may apply in countries that are not members of the 
EU.</li>
	<li>Distributors of the substances and preparations discussed 
above are obligated to accept these items back after use or to 
ensure they are accepted by a third party of their choosing.</li>
	<li>Maintenance and decommissioning of items containing 
refrigerant that are named in the legislation Substances and 
preparations named in this legislation may only be accepted by 
those with the necessary expertise and technical equipment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Criminal offenses and infringements of the law</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Infringement of the law in regard to the laws mentioned 
above. Willfully or negligently venting refrigerant into the air 
when operating, repairing or decommissioning items That contain 
refrigerant constitutes a violation of the laws and legislation 
described above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Observe the different technical regulations for handling and 
filling compressed gases (for example TRGS 400, TRGS 402, TRGS 
407 TRGS 510 TRGS 725/TRBS3145).</p>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<p><em>The TRGS (technical regulations for compressed gases) are 
listed (concerning vehicle manufacturers and workshops) below.</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>TRGS 400 (hazard assessment for activities with hazardous

</ul>
<p>Observe the different technical regulations for handling and 
filling compressed gases (for example TRGS 400, TRGS 402, TRGS 
407 TRGS 510 TRGS 725/TRBS3145).</p>
<ul>
	<li>General regulations for charging systems </li>
	<li>Definition of terms and explanatory notes</li>
	<li>Build and operation of charging systems</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Charging systems</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Does not apply to vehicle manufacturers or workshops.</li>
	<li>Charging systems are systems for filling mobile 
compressed-gas containers. The charging system includes the 
premises and facilities concerned.</li>
	<li>Charging systems requiring a permit are ones used to 
transfer compressed gases to mobile compressed-gas containers 
for supplying to third parties.</li>
	<li>Charging systems not requiring a permit are ones used for 
transferring compressed gases to mobile compressed-gas 
containers for internal use only.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Employees and employee instruction</strong></p>
<p>-&nbsp;Employees are to be given instruction on the following 
topics before beginning work and at regular, appropriate 
intervals, however at least once a year</p>
<ul>
	<li>Hazards specifically associated with handling compressed 
gases</li>
	<li>The safety regulations, especially the present TRGS and 
TRBS.</li>
	<li>Procedures in the event of malfunction, damage and accidents</li>
	<li>The use of fire-extinguishing and protective equipment</li>
	<li>Operation and maintenance of the charging system on the 
basis of the instructions for use</li>
</ul>
<p>Charging systems are only to be operated and maintained by 
personnel.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Aged 18 and above</li>
	<li>Possessing the necessary technical knowledge.</li>
	<li>Who can be relied on to work diligently.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/books/2001/hinweis.gif">&nbsp; 
<strong>Note</strong></p>
<p><em>Supervised work may also be performed by personnel that do 
not meet the requirements stipulated.</em></p>
<p>Filling of pressure containers (separate technical 
regulations apply to containers from other countries and their 
charging, that are not mentioned here).</p>
<ul>
	<li>A compressed-gas container is only to be filled with the 
compressed gas declared on it and the quantity must comply with 
the stipulated pressure, weight or volume data. Refer to 
pressure container regulations.</li>
	<li>In the case of containers approved for use with several 
types of compressed gas, the compressed gas with which it is to 
be filled and - if the compressed gas has a critical temperature 
greater than or equal to -10 ºC (-14 ºF) - the maximum 
permissible charging weight in line with TRGS must be marked on 
the container prior to connection for filling.</li>
	<li>Compressed-gas containers marked with the maximum 
permissible charge pressure in bar (psi) at 15 ºC (59 ºF) must 
be filled manometrically. If, at the time of filling, the 
temperature is not 15 ºC (59 ºF), the pressure corresponding to 
the prevailing temperature must be established; it must be 
ensured that the permissible charge pressure at 15 ºC (59 ºF) is 
not exceeded in the compressed- gas container. The charged 
containers are to be checked by way of random pressure 
measurements to determine possible overfilling.</li>
	<li>Compressed-gas containers on which the maximum permissible 
capacity is indicated by the net weight (filling weight, 
permissible weight of fill) in kilograms must be filled 
gravimetrically. The containers are to be weighed during filling 
and subsequently subjected to a weight check on special scales 
to establish possible overfilling. Scales used for this purpose 
must be calibrated.</li>
	<li>Under certain conditions, gases with a critical temperature 
greater than or equal to 70 ºC (158 ºF) may be transferred 
volumetrically from compressed-gas containers with a maximum 
volume of 150 l to compressed-gas containers with a volume of 
maximum 1000 ccm. The stipulations of the TRGS apply to the 
transfer of liquefied gas to cylinders used by workmen.</li>
	<li>Different TRGS applies to containers in vehicles:</li>
</ul>
<p>-&nbsp;For gas with critical temperature ≥ +70 ºC (158 ºF).</p>
<p>-&nbsp;For industrial gas with critical temperature ≥ +70 ºC (158 
ºF).</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Liquefied extremely low-temperature compressed gases may be 
filled differently according to volume (volumetrically) if the 
charging system and/or the containers is/are equipped with 
devices for measuring or limiting the volume of the charge and 
for measuring the temperature of the charge. When filling 
volumetrically, it must be ensured that the permissible charge 
weight indicated on the container is not exceeded. To determine 
possible overfilling, the filled containers are to be checked 
gravimetrically on a calibrated scale or, provided that the 
pressurized gases are not highly toxic, volumetrically. 
Volumetric checking requires the use of appropriate equipment. 
The charging and checking devices must be independent of each 
other.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Charging and check measurements are to be performed by 
different people. Check measurements must be performed 
immediately upon completion of the filling process.</li>
	<li>Overfilled containers must be drained immediately and in a 
safe manner until the permissible fill is attained. The 
compressed-gas fill is then to be determined again.</li>
	<li>Specific TRGS 407 components do not or only partially apply 
to containers for liquefied, extremely low-temperature 
compressed gases which are neither flammable nor toxic; this 
does not affect the provisions of road traffic legislation.</li>
	<li>When filling compressed gas containers with liquefied gases 
at charging temperatures less than or equal to -20 ºC (-4 ºF), 
the compressed gas container (if the container material has not 
been tested for temperatures less than or equal to -20 ºC (-4 
ºF) ) is not to be released from the charging system for 
transportation until the container wall temperature is greater 
than or equal to +20 ºC (68 ºF).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recycling and Disposal Regulations</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Specifications and rules for handling and disposing of 
refrigerants and refrigerant oils can be found in the 
chemical-climate protection provision and recycling and disposal 
regulations. These are valid in Germany. Different 
specifications and rules may apply in other countries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disposal of refrigerant</strong></p>
<p>Refrigerants intended for disposal are to be transferred to 
marked recycling containers, observing the permissible filling 
quantity. Refer to the chemical-climate protection provision and 
the recycling and disposal regulations in Germany. Different 
specifications and rules may apply in other countries.</p>
<p><strong>Disposal of refrigerant oil</strong></p>
<p>Used refrigerant oils from systems employing halogenated 
hydrocarbons are to be disposed of as waste subject to special 
supervision. They are not to be mixed with other oils or 
substances. Proper storage and disposal must be ensured in line 
with local regulations. Note the chemical-climate protection 
provision and the recycling and disposal regulations, for 
example, in Germany. Different specifications and rules may 
apply in other countries.</p><ul></ul></table></ul><div style="clear:both"></div><div align="center"></div><h2 style="border-top:1px solid #222; padding-top:15px; margin-top: 15px;">READ NEXT:</h2>
