	<li><em>The temperature of the air after the evaporator, the current 
A/C compressor speed and the pressure of the refrigerant on the

example from the Thermal Management Control Module -J1024-, from 
the Front A/C Display Control Head -E87- or from the Climatronic

	<li><em>If a high cooling output is required (for example, a high 
outside temperature and the blower speed set on high), then the 
A/C compressor will not bring the pressure on the low pressure 
side to the required value (for example, for a certain time 
after turning on the A/C). The A/C compressor is not actuated at 
the maximum specified speed (of approximately 8500/min) on a 
stationary or slow moving vehicle (up to a speed of 
approximately 45km/h) (the A/C compressor speed is limited to 
approximately 5000/min). After a vehicle reaches a speed of more 
than approximately 45 km/h, the limit for the maximum 
permissible A/C compressor speed is lifted. At a A/C compressor 
speed of 5000/min, a high outside temperature and a high fresh 
air blower speed (inefficient environmental controls), the A/C 
compressor output (the delivery volume) is no longer sufficient 
to reduce the pressure on the low pressure side to the target 
value. To check the A/C compressor control under these 
conditions, for example, the fresh air blower is controlled only 
with approximately 40% of the maximum voltage, check the 
pressures at a lower fresh air blower speed. Use the Vehicle

Normal ambient pressure corresponds to 1 bar absolute pressure. 
0 bar pressure corresponds to an absolute pressure of 1 bar on 
most pressure gauges (indicated by -1 bar below 0).</em></li>
	<li><em>If on a vehicle with two evaporators (one in the heater and 
A/C unit and one for cooling the heater and A/C unit for example

the heat exchanger for the heat pump function) depending on the 
selected function on a component the measured temperature or 
pressure, the specified value corresponds to another component

	<li><em>For the correct A/C function it is also necessary that 
depending on the selected functions of the respective heater 
cores enough heat is supplied or removed. Pay attention for this 
reason to the incorporation of the heater core in the respective

function of the pumps and valves installed in it. Use the

	<li><em>Since the evaporator for cooling the high-voltage components 
output (in the battery cooling module and in the high-voltage 
battery heat exchanger) is smaller than the evaporator output in 
the heater and A/C unit, the required target temperature may 
still be reached in the evaporator for cooling the high-voltage 
battery with too little refrigerant in the refrigerant circuit, 
but the target temperature in the heater and A/C unit evaporator 
will no longer be attainable (even though the A/C compressor is 
activated with increased A/C unit speed).</em></li>

	<li><em>Overfilling with refrigerant oil can occur if, for example, the 
compressor has been replaced without adjusting the quantity of 
refrigerant oil.</em></li>
	<li><em>If for example the expansion valve for the evaporator in the A/C 
unit or for the evaporator for cooling the high-voltage battery is 
faulty (always open) the evaporator temperature (in the heater and A/C 
unit) is no longer regulated that only refrigerant in gaseous state 
exits from the evaporator. Under certain usage conditions, liquid 
droplets may then be drawn in by the compressor and cause noise (liquid 
cannot be compressed).</em></li>
	<li><em>If there is too much refrigerant oil in the circuit, the compressor 
must be drained and the receiver/dryer must be replaced. After cleaning 
the refrigerant circuit by flushing with refrigerant R134a. Refer to
→&nbsp;Chapter "Refrigerant Circuit, Cleaning (Flushing), with Refrigerant 
R134a". Fill the refrigerant circuit with the correct 
quantity of refrigerant. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Chapter "Approved Refrigerant Oils and Capacities".</em></li>

	<li><em>If the required cooling output on the evaporator in the front heater 
and A/C unit (and on the evaporator for cooling the high-voltage battery 
is OK) and there is a concern due to insufficient heating performance on 
the heat exchanger for the heat pump operation. The cause may be in the 
high-voltage system coolant circuit or in the engine coolant circuit. If 
the pumps and valves in the high-voltage system coolant circuit is not 
activated correctly or its function is not OK via the evaporator (heat 
exchanger) for the high-voltage system components not enough heat energy 
is absorbed from the coolant. If the pumps and valves in the coolant 
circuit of the engine are not started correctly or its function are not 
OK via the heat exchanger for the heat pump function for absorbing the 
heat energy is not transferred to the coolant flowing to the heat 
exchanger in the heater and A/C unit. Use the Vehicle Diagnostic Tester

function and refer to 
→&nbsp;Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.87;&nbsp;Coolant Circuit
