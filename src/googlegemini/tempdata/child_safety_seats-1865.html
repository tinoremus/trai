			<p><p><u><strong>General information</strong></u></p>
<p>When installing and using child safety seats, follow
the information in this Owner's Manual, the
applicable state and federal regulations, and the
manufacturer instructions for the child safety
seat.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>To reduce the risk of serious or fatal injuries,
children must always be secured in the vehicle
with a child safety seat that is appropriate for
their body size, weight, and age.</u></strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong><u>Children ages 12 and under must be transported
	using the appropriate child safety
	seat. Note differences in regulations between
	states and countries.</u></strong></li>
	<li><strong><u>Child safety seats secured incorrectly in the
	vehicle may cause serious or fatal injuries in
	the event of an accident. Always secure the
	child safety seat according to the manufacturer
	instructions.</u></strong></li>
	<li><strong><u>Children or babies must not under any circumstances
	be held on the lap of the driver
	or other passengers while driving.</u></strong></li>
	<li><strong><u>Do not secure more than one child in a child
	safety seat.</u></strong></li>
	<li><strong><u>Never allow a child to sit in a child safety
	seat unsupervised.</u></strong></li>
	<li><strong><u>Never allow children to ride unsecured in
	the vehicle or to stand or kneel on the seats
	while driving. In the event of an accident, a
	child could be propelled through the vehicle.</u></strong><p><strong><u>
	This can cause serious or fatal injuries for
	the child and passengers.</u></strong></p></li>
	<li><strong><u>If children use an incorrect seating position while driving, they 
	have a higher risk of injury during a sudden braking maneuver or
	accident. This especially applies to children
	in the front passenger's seat or children who
	have their head near the side airbag deployment
	area, if the airbag system is deployed
	during an accident. This incorrect seating
	position can cause severe or even fatal injuries</u></strong></li>
	<li><strong><u>Make sure there is enough space in front of
	the child in the child safety seat. If necessary,
	adjust the angle and position of the seat
	in front of the child safety seat.</u></strong></li>
	<li><strong><u>The rear side of a forward-facing child safety
	seat should be positioned as close as possible
	to the backrest on the vehicle seat. If the
	head restraints make it difficult to install a
	child safety seat, adjust or remove them if
	necessary. Reinstall the head restraints
	immediately once the child safety
	seat has been removed.</u></strong></li>
	<li><strong><u>Always make sure that the backrest on the
	seat where the child safety seat is installed
	is securely locked in place and cannot move
	forward. Otherwise, the backrest where the
	child safety seat is secured could move forward
	in the event of an accident or other
	emergency situation.</u></strong></li>
	<li><strong><u>NEVER use a rear-facing child safety seat on
	a seat with an ACTIVATED FRONT AIRBAG;
	this could cause DEATH or SERIOUS INJURIES
	to a CHILD.</u></strong><ul>
		<li><u><strong>Always secure child safety seats on the
		rear seats. If exceptional circumstances require
		the child safety seat to be placed on
		the front passenger's seat, then the front
		passenger's airbag must be deactivated.</strong></u><p><u><strong>
		Always make sure that
		PASSENGER AIR BAG OFF </strong></u><strong>
		<img border="0" src="images/books/1816/index.93(2).png"></strong><u><strong> stays on
		while driving. If
		PASSENGER AIR BAG OFF </strong></u><strong>
		<img border="0" src="images/books/1816/index.93(2).png"></strong><u><strong> does not
		turn on, remove the child safety seat and
		install it again according to the child safety
		seat manufacturer instructions. If
		PASSENGER AIR BAG OFF </strong></u><strong>
		<img border="0" src="images/books/1816/index.93(2).png"></strong><u><strong> still does
		not turn on, the front passenger's seat
		must not be used. Drive to an authorized
		Audi dealer or authorized Audi Service Facility
		and have the airbag system inspected.</strong></u></p></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><u><strong>If you must use a forward-facing child safety
	seat on the front passenger's seat, move the
	seat as far back as possible so that it is as
	far as possible from the front passenger's
	airbag. While doing this, make sure the seat
	can be adjusted all the way. A child in a child
	safety seat on the front passenger's seat can
	receive a severe impact if the front passenger's
	airbag deploys, which increases the risk
	of serious or fatal injury.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Replace the child safety seat after an accident
	because there could be damage that is
	not visible.</strong></u></li>
	<li><u><strong>Even if a child is not sitting in the child safety
	seat, the child safety seat must be secured.</strong></u><p><u><strong>
	An unsecured child safety seat may
	be thrown through the vehicle interior during
	sudden braking maneuvers or an accident.</strong></u></p></li>
</ul>
<p><u><strong>Correct positioning for children</strong></u></p>
<p>Always secure children in a child safety seat designed
for the body size, weight, and age of the
child.</p>
<p>
You can secure child safety seats in your vehicle
using the lower LATCH anchors or the safety
belts. You can also secure child safety seats to
the top tether anchor. Depending on the child
safety seat, it may also be necessary to secure it
to the top tether anchor. In Canada, securing forward-
facing child safety seats to the top tether
anchors is required by law.</p>
<p><strong>Always transport children in the rear seats</strong></p>
<p>Accident statistics show that children that are secured
correctly in the rear seats are safer than in
front seats. Always transport children in suitable
child safety seats secured on the rear seats.</p>
<p><strong>In exceptional circumstances: transporting
children in the front passenger's seat</strong></p>
<p>If exceptional circumstances require the child
safety seat to be placed on the front passenger's
seat, then the front passenger's airbag must be
deactivated. Please note the important information for this, Advanced airbag
system. If you must secure a forward-facing child
safety seat, move the front passenger's seat as
far back as possible so that it is as far as possible
from the front passenger's airbag. While doing
this, make sure the seat can be adjusted all the
way.</p>
<p><strong>Only switch to a larger child safety seat when
absolutely necessary</strong></p>
<p>Switch to a larger child safety seat only when absolutely
necessary. Secure your child using a safety
belt without a child safety seat only if all of the
following statements are true:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The child is large enough to sit upright in the
	seat</li>
	<li>The child is able to sit with his or her back resting
	completely on the seat backrest</li>
	<li>The child is able to sit with his or her knees
	bent over the edge of the seat surface</li>
	<li>The child is able to sit with both of his or her
	feet completely touching the floor in the footwell</li>
	<li>The lap portion of the safety belt lies flat and
	securely over the hip area and never over the
	stomach</li>
	<li>The shoulder portion of the safety belt lies flat
	and securely over the center of the shoulder
	and the chest, and never under the arm, behind
	the back, or over the neck or face.</li>
	<li>The child is able to maintain this seating position
	throughout the entire trip</li>
</ul>
<p>Read and follow the important information and
warnings regarding the correct use of safety
belts.</p>
<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Child safety seats can also be secured to
	seats with side airbags. In the event of an
	accident, children can also be protected by
	the side airbags if the child is correctly secured
	in a suitable child safety seat that is
	attached correctly.</em></li>
	<li><em>The lower LATCH anchors as well as the
	safety belt may be required to correctly install
	some child safety seats. Using both at
	the same time is permitted, provided that the fastening systems or safety 
	belts do not
	impair those in an adjacent seating position.</em></li>
	<li><em>All child safety seats are constructed so that
	they can be secured using the lap safety belt
	in the vehicle.</em></li>
	<li><em>Child safety seats with a load leg can only
	be secured to the outer rear seats and to the
	front passenger's seat.</em></li>
