	<li>Various adapters which are required to connect the Air 
Conditioning (A/C) service station to the refrigerant circuit 
for flushing and to bridge the removed receiver/dryer or 
reservoir and expansion valve (specific to vehicle) are in the 
following table.</li>
	<li>Using a charge hose with 5/8 -18 UNF connections (short 
version, for example Refrigerant Circuits Adapter Set 1 - 
Adapter 31 -VAS6338/31-), connect the two adapters (contained in 
Refrigerant Circuits Adapter Set 1 -VAS6338/1-) which have been 
installed for the removed reservoir or receiver/dryer.</li>
	<li>If a flushed refrigerant circuit is not reassembled 
immediately after flushing, adapters remain at connections and 
seal the connections at the adapters using Refrigerant Circuits 
Adapter Set 1 - Adapter 30 -VAS6338/30- (from Refrigerant 
Circuits Adapter Set 1 -VAS6338/1-).</li>
	<li>Depending on the version of the compressor and time period 
of production, different connection and sealing techniques can 
be found for the refrigerant circuit. Refer to
→&nbsp;Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.87;&nbsp;System 
Overview - Refrigerant Circuit (vehicle-specific 
repair manual).</li>
	<li>Beginning from production year 2006, the name of the "Zexel" 
A/C compressor was changed from "Zexel" to "Valeo".</li>

	<li><em>There are different versions of the A/C unit (different 
heater core and sears different expansion valve etc.) depending 
on time period of production and from the VIN number on Audi 
A1/S1. Refer to the Parts Catalog. For vehicles with the type 
key "8X1" and "8XA" in the VIN number an expansion valve is 
installed, on those where both refrigerant lines are attached 
above, here the Refrigerant Circuits Adapter Set 1 - Adapter 34 
-VAS6338/34- fits. For vehicles with the type key "8XF" and

<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>The version of the receiver/dryer on the Audi A3, Audi Q3 
and Audi TT will differ depending on the manufacturer of the 
condenser. An Audi TT (8J_) from MY 2007 with a 5-cylinder 
engine has a different condenser version than on models with a 
4- or 6-cylinder engine. The receiver/dryer is, for example, 
inside the condenser. The integrated receiver/dryer has a dryer 
cartridge that is no longer available as a replacement part. If 
there are complaints, then it is necessary to replace the 
complete condenser. Refer to the Parts Catalog and

<strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><em>On the Audi A3 e-tron the refrigerant circuit is flushed in 
two sections. In the first flushing cycle, the adapter, which is 
installed for the Heater and A/C Unit Refrigerant Cut-Off Valve 
-N541-, is opened and the adapter, which is installed for the 
High Voltage Battery Heater Core Refrigerant Cut-Off Valve 
-N542- is closed. Thus the refrigerant circuit with the 
evaporator in the A/C unit is flushed. In the second flushing 
cycle, the adapter, which is installed for the Heater and A/C 
Unit Refrigerant Cut-Off Valve -N541-, is closed and the 
adapter, which is installed for the High Voltage Battery Heater 
Core Refrigerant Cut-Off Valve -N542- is opened. From this the 
refrigerant circuit with the evaporator in the high voltage 
battery heat exchanger is flushed. Refer to 
→&nbsp;Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.87;&nbsp;System 
Overview - Refrigerant Circuit (vehicle-specific 
repair manual).</em></li>
	<li><em>This illustration shows a refrigerant line
-A- with a permanently installed 
restrictor -B- (without a strainer) 
This refrigerant line is drilled with a suitable drill 5.0 mm to 
flush the refrigerant circuit (an inserted restrictor is 
removed) and cleaned in the flushing circuit before installing. 
The drilled refrigerant line is replaced after flushing. Refer 
to the Parts Catalog.</em></li>
	<li><em>The diameter of the illustrated variable orifice
-B- is approximately 0.7 mm. 
Depending on the version of the refrigerant line this 
constriction is either installed fixed in the refrigerant line 
or only inserted. For the inserted version a strainer for 
flowing deposits may be installed, which can be blocked by the 
variable orifice.</em></li>
	<li><em>The version of the receiver/dryer on the Audi A3 will differ 
depending on the manufacturer of the condenser. The 
receiver/dryer is, for example, inside the condenser. The 
integrated receiver/dryer has a dryer cartridge that is no 
longer available as a replacement part. If there are complaints,

	<li><em>In vehicles with two evaporators, the refrigerant circuit is 
flushed in two/three work steps.</em></li>
	<li><em>Currently the expansion valve on the evaporator in the A/C 
unit and on the evaporator in the battery cooling module do not 
have the same connections.</em></li>
	<li><em>The refrigerant circuit cannot be rinsed with a Hybrid 
Battery Refrigerant Shut-Off Valve 1 -N516- installed in the 
circuit to the evaporator in the A/C unit. The Hybrid Battery 
Refrigerant Shut-Off Valve 1 -N516- is in a constricted location 
and prevents the refrigerant from reaching a sufficient flow 
speed. If a Shut-Off Valve -VAS6338/42- is available, install 
and open it for the Hybrid Battery Refrigerant Shut-Off Valve 1 
-N516-. If the Shut-Off Valve -VAS6338/42- is not available, but 
there are two A/C Adapter Set - Adapters 5 -VAG1785/5- and the 
circuit with the evaporator in the A/C unit can be rinsed in one 
work procedure (reassemble the circuit with a filler hose and 
two A/C Adapter Set - Adapters 5 -VAG1785/5-). If the Shut-Off 
Valves -VAS6338/42- is not available and there is only one A/C 
Adapter Set - Adapters 5 -VAG1785/5- available, the circuit must 
be flushed in two steps. From the low pressure connection on the 
A/C compressor via the evaporator in the A/C unit up to the 
connection for the removed Hybrid Battery Refrigerant Shut-Off 
Valve 1 -N516- and from the connection for the removed Hybrid 
Battery Refrigerant Shut-Off Valve 1 -N516- via the condenser to 
the high pressure connection on the A/C compressor. </em> </li>
	<li><em>There are different versions of the receiver/dryer on this 
vehicle, depending on the condenser manufacturer. Refer to
→&nbsp;Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning;&nbsp;Rep. Gr.87;&nbsp;System 
Overview - Refrigerant Circuit (vehicle-specific 
repair manual). The receiver/dryer may be attached to or 
integrated in the condenser, depending on the version of the 
condenser. The integrated receiver/dryer has a dryer cartridge 
that is no longer available as a replacement part. In the event 
there is a complaint on a vehicle with this condenser, the 
condenser must be completely replaced. Refer to the Parts 
Catalog.</em></li>
	<li><em>If the receiver/dryer or dryer cartridge is integrated in 
the condenser, then it cannot be replaced separately or is not 
available as a single part, and the condenser must be replaced.
